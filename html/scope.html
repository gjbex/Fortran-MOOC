<h1 id="scope-in-fortran">Scope in Fortran</h1>
<p>The scope of a name binding, e.g., a variable or procedure, is the
part of the source code where that name binding can be used. In Fortran,
declarations of variables, types, interfaces and so on have to be done
at the start of a compilation unit, and their scope is the compilation
unit they are declared in.</p>
<p>A variable, type or interface can be used from the point where it is
declared in the compilation unit. For instance, the variable
<code>i</code> in the code fragment below needs to be declared before it
is used in the implicit do loop on the line below.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>integer :: i
integer, dimension(5) :: v = [ (i, i=1, 5) ]</code></pre>
<p>If a compilation unit is part of another compilation unit, e.g., a
procedure defined in the program unit, the scope of name bindings
extends to the entire program unit, so also to the compilation units
that it contains.</p>
<p>A binding to a name in a compilation will shadow a binding to the
same name in the enclosing compilation unit. For example, the variable
<code>i</code> in the function unit will shadow the variable
<code>i</code> in the program unit.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>program main
    ...
    integer :: i
    ...
    i = 5
    print *, f(10)
    ...
contains

    integer function f(val)
        ...
        integer :: i
        ...
        i = 7
        f = i*val
    end function f

end program main</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>i</code> in the function <code>f</code> refers to
a different memory location than the one in the program unit. Hence the
assignment to <code>i</code> in the function does not affect the value
of the variable in the program unit, which will still be 5 after the
call of function <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>However, if <code>i</code> were not declared in the compilation unit
function <code>f</code>, the value of the variable <code>i</code>
<em>would</em> be changed in the program unit. This is of course a
potential source of bugs, so it is quite important that all variables
intended to be local to a compilation unit are declared in that
unit.</p>
<p>Procedures that are defined in a compilation unit can be used in that
entire unit.</p>
<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>
<p>A module is a compilation unit, so all variables, types, interfaces
and procedures are defined in the scope of that unit. However, they can
be imported into the scope of another compilation unit using a
<code>use</code> statement, provided they are declared public.</p>
<p>It is good practice to import only those entities into the scope of a
compilation unit that are required, so as not to pollute the name space
inadvertently.</p>
<h2 id="block-statement">Block statement</h2>
<p>The Fortran 2008 specification introduced the block statement. This
allows to limit the scope of variables to the block in which they are
defined.</p>
<p>The program below would not compile since the variable <code>i</code>
is declared in the block, but used outside of it. The variableâ€™s scope
will not exceed the block and hence is not declared in the program unit
as a whole.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>program block_scope
    implicit none

    block
        integer :: i = 5
        print *, i
    end block
    print *, i
end program block_scope</code></pre>
<p>In general, it is good practice to limit the scope of entities as
much as possible, so the introduction of block statements is a welcome
addition to the Fortran specification.</p>
