<h1 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h1>
<p>A very important aspect of object oriented programming is
inheritance, i.e., creating classes that extend or specializing aspects
of an existing class.</p>
<p>Suppose you would like to add functionality to the
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code> user defined type. You can already
compute the mean value and the standard deviation, but now you are also
interested in the median of the data set.</p>
<p>To compute the median, you first have to sort your data values, and
the median is * the middle value if the number of data values is odd,
and * the average of the two middle values when the number of data
values is even.</p>
<p>This means that you can only compute the median if you keep track of
all the values. However, a nice feature of the
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code> implementation was that you could
compute the mean and the standard deviation without that requirement.
Since there will still be situation where you can’t or won’t compute the
median, adding that functionality directly to
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code> would be very limiting and make the
class less useful. Hence it seems a creating a new class, say
<code>median_stats_t</code> is the best option.</p>
<p>Of course you could simply copy the procedures
<code>get_nr_values</code>, <code>get_mean</code> and
<code>get_stddev</code> from <code>descriptive_stats_t</code> into
<code>median_stats_t</code> and be done with it. However, that would not
be ideal. Suppose you find a bug in the implementation of
<code>get_stddev</code>, you would have to fix the same code in two
places, both for <code>descriptive_stats_t</code> and
<code>median_stats_t</code>. This is quite error prone since it is
likely that you will forget to fix one of the versions and be faced with
some interesting bugs.</p>
<p>Since an object of class <code>median_stats_t</code> should be able
to compute the mean and standard deviation, and the procedures to
accomplish that are identical to those in
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code>, it would be very convenient if the
latter could be used as the basis for <code>median_stats_t</code> which
would extend it with data and procedures to compute the median as
well.</p>
<p>This is exactly what inheritance accomplishes. Consider the
definition of <code>median_stats_t</code> below.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>type, extends(descriptive_stats_t), public :: median_stats_t
    private
    real, dimension(:), allocatable :: values
contains
    procedure, public, pass :: add_value, get_median
    final :: finalize_stats
end type median_stats_t
interface median_stats_t
    module procedure init_stats
end interface</code></pre>
<p>The attribute <code>extends</code> ensures that the user defined type
<code>median_stats_t</code> will have all the elements and type bound
procedures that <code>descriptive_stats_t</code> has. So
<code>median_stats_t</code> will have the elements
<code>nr_values</code>, <code>sum</code> and <code>sum2</code> as well
as the type bound procedures <code>get_nr_values</code>,
<code>get_mean</code> and <code>get_stddev</code>, although they are not
mentioned explicitly.</p>
<p>The user defined type <code>median_stats_t</code> has an additional
element <code>values</code> to store all data values added with the
<code>add_value</code> method. Hence it should have its own
implementation of the <code>add_value</code> method. It also has two
additional type bound procedures <code>get_median</code> and
<code>finalize_stats</code>.</p>
<p>the procedures <code>init_stats</code> and
<code>finalize_stats</code> will be discussed in a later section.</p>
<p>In object oriented parlance, <code>descriptive_stats_t</code> is
called the <em>base class</em> or the <em>parent class</em>, while
<code>median_stats_t</code> is called a <em>derived class</em> or
<em>child class</em> of <code>descriptive_stats_t</code>. In this case
we have only a single base class and a single derived class, but there
may be situation in which the derived class is used as the base class
for another class, creating a multi-level hierarchy. If so, the terms
<em>ancestor class</em> and <em>descendant class</em> are used to refer
to classes higher and lower in the derivation hierarchy.</p>
<p>As opposed to C++ or Python, Fortran supports single inheritance
only, so a class can have one parent class, not multiple. This implies
that the derivation relationship between classes can be represented as a
tree. This design decision sidesteps a number of issues associated with
multiple inheritance.</p>
<p>Although this may seem like a limitation, it is easy to overcome by
using, e.g., the facade design pattern. It would lead us too far to go
into the details, but you can read the article <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/126069">Emulating multiple
inheritance in Fortran 2003/2008</a></em> by Karla Morris if you are
interested.</p>
<h2 id="overriding-procedures">Overriding procedures</h2>
<p>The <code>add_value</code> procedure bound to
<code>median_stats_t</code> should do more that the one bound to
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code>. However, it can rely on the
implementation for <code>descriptive_stats_t</code> to update
<code>nr_values</code>, <code>sum</code> and <code>sum2</code>. It
should additionally ensure that the new value is also stored in the
array <code>values</code>.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>subroutine add_value(stats, new_value)
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : error_unit
    implicit none
    class(median_stats_t), intent(inout) :: stats
    real, value :: new_value

    if (stats%get_nr_values() + 1 &gt; size(stats%values)) then
        write (unit=error_unit, fmt='(A, I0, A)') &amp;
            'error: capacity exceeded, maximum ', size(stats%values), &amp;
            ' can be processed'
        stop 4
    end if
    call stats%descriptive_stats_t%add_value(new_value)
    stats%values(stats%get_nr_values()) = new_value
end subroutine add_value</code></pre>
<p>Since the array <code>values</code> has some size, this
implementation of the procedure <code>add_value</code> will first check
whether the new value can still be stored. If so, the values of
<code>nr_values</code>, <code>sum</code> and <code>sum2</code> should be
updated, but this can conveniently be done by calling the procedure
<code>add_value</code> defined in <code>descriptive_stats_t</code>. You
can call procedures defined in an ancestor class by using its name as a
prefix, i.e., <code>stats%descriptive_stats_t%add_value</code> in this
case. Lastly, the procedure will add the new value to the array
<code>values</code> at index <code>nr_values</code> which refers to the
next empty element in <code>values</code> since it was incremented by
the call to <code>descriptive_stats_t</code>’s
<code>add_value</code>.</p>
<p>The procedure <code>get_median</code> is specific to the
<code>median_stats_t</code> class, so this is not inherited from the
parent class. The implementation relies on a sorting algorithm to sort
<code>values</code>; you can find it in the repository.</p>
<h2 id="class-versus-type"><code>class</code> versus
<code>type</code></h2>
<p>Now is a better time to explain why <code>class</code> is used rather
than <code>type</code> to declare the type of arguments to type bound
procedures. When a variable or procedure argument is declared using
<code>class</code> it can hold a value that is an object of that class,
or of any of that class’ descendant classes.</p>
<p>This implies that for type bound procedures a procedure that is
defined in the parent class can be used in a derived class.</p>
<p>The use of <code>class</code> declarations is not restricted to
procedure arguments though. The following code fragment illustrates that
you can decide at runtime whether to use a
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code> or <code>median_stats_t</code>
variable, and how to distinguish between the types of values.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
class(descriptive_stats_t), allocatable :: stats
...
if (stats_type == 'median') then
    allocate (stats, source=median_stats_t(nr_values))
else
    allocate (stats, source=descriptive_stats_t())
end if</code></pre>
<p>Since the variable <code>stats</code> is declared as
<code>class(descriptive_stats_t)</code>, it can store a object of type
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code>, or any of that class’ descendant
classes, i.e., <code>median_stats_t</code> in this case.</p>
<p>Although not strictly required, a named interface
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code> was added to create an initializer for
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code>. The <code>source</code> argument of
the <code>allocate</code> statement is used to clone the constructed
object.</p>
<p>This is an instance of <em>runtime polymorphism</em>, i.e., the type
of a variable is determined at runtime. The most convenient way to
exploit runtime polymorphism is through allocatable variables as you saw
in the code sample above.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-types-and-classes">Selecting types and classes</h2>
<p>Since the variable <code>stats</code> can be either a
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code> or a <code>median_stats_t</code>
object, and the method <code>get_median</code> can only be called on
objects of the class <code>median_stats_t</code>, you would need a way
to determine at runtime what the class or type of an object is.</p>
<p>Fortran has the <code>select type</code> statement to accomplish
this. Its general form is</p>
<pre><code>select type (&lt;target&gt;)
    type is (&lt;type name 1&gt;)
        &lt;block statements 1&gt;
    type is (&lt;type name 2&gt;)
        &lt;block statements 2&gt;
    ...
    class default
        &lt;block statements 3&gt;
end select</code></pre>
<p>You can replace the type-guard <code>type is</code> by
<code>class is</code> if you want to check not only for the type itself,
but also for all its descendants. The <code>class default</code> type
guard is optional. As you can guess, there can only be a single
<code>case default</code> type guard, but you can have any number of
<code>type is</code> and <code>class is</code> guard clauses. However,
only a single block of code is executed, even if multiple select clauses
match. 1. If there is a <code>type</code> clause that matches, the
corresponding block of statements is executed. 1. If that is not the
case, but one or more <code>class</code> clauses match, the one for the
type that is the highest up in the derivation hierarchy. 1. If no
<code>class</code> clauses match, and a <code>class default</code>
clause is present, the corresponding statement block is executed.</p>
<p>For example, now you can check whether <code>stats</code> is of class
<code>median_stats_t</code>, and if so, print the median.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
print '(A, F10.3)', 'mean   = ', stats%get_mean()
select type (stats)
    class is (median_stats_t)
        print '(A, F10.3)', 'median   = ', stats%get_median()
end select
print '(A, F10.3)', 'stddev = ', stats%get_stddev()
...</code></pre>
<p>Here we use <code>class is</code> because all descendants of the
<code>median_stats_t</code> class should also either inherit or override
the <code>get_median</code> function (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov’s
substitution principle</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>select type</code> statement has an additional features
that is worth mentioning: The <code>select type</code> statement can
associate an alias, similar to the <code>associate</code> statement.</p>
<h1 id="interlude-initialization-and-finalization">Interlude:
initialization and finalization</h1>
<p>In the previous section we have been using the array
<code>values</code> to store data values and compute the median. That
array was declared <code>allocatable</code>, but where and when should
it be allocated? This is where the procedures <code>init_stats</code>
and <code>finalize_stats</code> come in that we didn’t discuss so far.
The name interface that we defined for the <code>median_stats_t</code>
was</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>interface median_stats_t
    module procedure init_stats
end interface</code></pre>
<p>When we create a new object of the the class
<code>median_stats_t</code>, the array <code>values</code> should be
allocated. This is done using the function <code>init_stats</code> that
returns an initialized instance of <code>median_stats_t</code>.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>function init_stats(nr_values) result(stats)
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : error_unit
    integer, value :: nr_values
    type(median_stats_t) :: stats

    allocate(stats%values(nr_values))
    if (.not. allocated(stats%values)) then
        write (unit=error_unit, fmt='(A, I0, A)') &amp;
            'error: can not allocated memory for ', nr_values, ' values'
        stop 3
    end if
end function init_stats</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>nr_values</code>, <code>sum</code> and <code>sum2</code>
are already initialized in the definition of the parent class
<code>descriptive_stats_t</code>.</p>
<p>The named interface <code>median_stats_t</code> ensures that the
procedure <code>init_stats</code> can be used conveniently, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
integer :: nr_values
type(median_stats_t) :: stats
...
stats = median_stats_t(nr_values)
...</code></pre>
<p>Here, the variable <code>nr_values</code> is (at least) the size of
the data set.</p>
<p>To avoid memory leaks, it is of course good practice to complement
<code>init_stats</code> with a procedure to deallocate the array when
the object is no longer required. The deallocation is implemented in the
<code>finalize_stats</code> procedure which is called automatically when
the object goes out of scope thanks to the <code>final</code>
attribute.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>subroutine finalize_stats(stats)
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : error_unit
    type(median_stats_t), intent(inout) :: stats
    integer :: istat

    deallocate(stats%values, stat=istat)
end subroutine finalize_stats</code></pre>
<p>Note that you could compare the procedure <code>init_stats</code> to
a <em>constructor</em> in C++ or the <code>__init__</code> method in
Python, while <code>finalize_stats</code> is similar to a C++
<em>destructor</em>.</p>
<p>As such, initializing/constructing and destructing objects is
completely independent of inheritance. It was introduced in this section
because it ties in well with the running example and our base class
didn’t require either.</p>
