<h1 id="interacting-with-the-environment">Interacting with the
environment</h1>
<p>Fortran programs are typically called from the command line. This
means that runtime parameters are passed as command line arguments and
environment variables.</p>
<h2 id="command-line-arguments">Command line arguments</h2>
<p>Fortran has two intrinsic procedures to deal with command line
arguments, the function <code>command_argument_count</code> and the
subroutine <code>get_command_argument</code>. As the name implies,
<code>command_argument_count</code> returns the number of arguments with
which the application is called.</p>
<p>For example, consider the Fortran application
<code>command_argument_test</code>.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ ./command_argument_test abc 123</code></pre>
<p>For this call, the value returned by
<code>command_argument_count</code> will return 2 since there are two
arguments on the command line, i.e., <code>abc</code> and
<code>123</code>.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>nr_args = command_argument_count()</code></pre>
<p>The subroutine <code>get_command_argument</code> takes two arguments,
the first is the number of the command line argument you want to
retrieve, so it should be between 1 and the number of command line
arguments as returned by <code>command_argument_count</code>. The second
argument is a character variable to which the subroutine will assign the
value passed on the command line.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>character(len=20) :: buffer
integer :: istat
call get_command_argument(1, buffer, status=istat)
if (istat /= 0) then
    ...</code></pre>
<p>The status variable will be zero if the call succeeded without
issues, it will be negative if the value was truncated, positive if the
call failed. It is of course good practice to check the status after a
call to <code>get_command_argument</code>.</p>
<p>The subroutine has an additional optional argument
<code>length</code> that can be used to retrieve the length of the
command argument.</p>
<p>Note that the values retrieved by <code>get_command_argument</code>
are always character values, so typically they have to be converted to
the appropriate data types. This can be done by reading from a string,
e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
integer :: nr_values
...
read (buffer, fmt='(I10)', iostat=istat, iomsg=msg) nr_values</code></pre>
<p>This is discussed in more detail in the section on reading formatted
data.</p>
<h2 id="command-name">Command name</h2>
<p>For some applications, it can be convenient to retrieve the command
as it was entered on the command line. For the running example, that
would be <code>./command_argument_test</code>.</p>
<p>The intrinsic subroutine <code>get_command</code> can be used to get
this string.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
character(len=128) :: command_name
...
call get_command(command_name)
...</code></pre>
<p>Note that the length of the character variable should be large
enough. If not, the name will be truncated</p>
<p>If you only want to retrieve the actual command and not its
arguments, you can call <code>get_command_argument</code> with 0 as its
first argument.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h2>
<p>Retrieving environment variables is very similar to retrieving
command line arguments. The relevant intrinsic subroutine is
<code>get_environment_variable</code>. For instance, the following code
fragment retrieves the value of the <code>HOME</code> environment
variable</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
character(len=256) :: home_dir
integer :: istat
...
call get_environment_variable('HOME', home_dir, status=istat)
if (istat /= 0) then
    ...</code></pre>
<p>It should be stressed once more that it is important to check the
status since your application may do some rather unexpected things when
a value is truncated.</p>
