<h1 id="libraries">Libraries</h1>
<p>Reinventing the wheel is typically not your best option. Many
libraries are available that implement data structures and algorithms
for scientific computing. Although it is very useful to understand the
algorithms you are using, perhaps even by implementing proof of concept,
it shouldnâ€™t be your choice for production code if a mature library is
available.</p>
<p>In this section a number of libraries are mentioned that cover the
fundamentals of scientific computing. Of course, there are many more out
there, so it pays off to do a thorough search before you embark on your
own development adventure.</p>
<p>Fast Fourier Transforms are important mathematical tools in many
domains. The <a href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW3</a> library is an
excellent implementation that has Fortran bindings and can be used for
sequential, multi-threaded and distributed code.</p>
<p>For linear algebra, BLAS and LAPACK have already been mentioned and
illustrated. For distributed programming, you can consider <a href="https://www.netlib.org/blacs/">BLACS</a> (Basic Linear Algebra
Communications Subprograms) to distribute the storage of arrays over
multiple processes. MPI is used to implement the communication that is
required.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/">ScaLAPACK</a> (Scalable
Linear Algebra PACKage), the distributed extension of LAPACK uses BLACS
under the hood to implement its linear algebra algorithms.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/">PETSc</a> (Portable,
Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computing) library is intended to
solve large partial differential equations. It uses MPI for
communication, supports GPUs either through CUDA or OpenCL as well as
hybrid MPI-GPU. It implements a wide range of linear and non-linear
solvers.</p>
<p>For eigenvalue problems at scale, there is <a href="https://slepc.upv.es/">SLEPc</a> (Scalable Library for Eigenvalue
Problems Computations). It is an extension of PETSc. It can for instance
be used to compute partial Singular Value Decompositions (SVD).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF</a>
(Network Common Data Form) is used in some scientific domains as an
alternative to HDF5. It has some advantages, e.g., it is easier to with
spherical coordinate systems. It uses HDF5 under the hood. It has a
counterpart for parallel I/O, <a href="https://parallel-netcdf.github.io/">PnetCDF</a>.</p>
<p>All the libraries listed above are open source software. However,
commercial counterparts exist, and may be worth considering. For
instance, <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html#gs.zx8nvs">Intel
MKL</a> (Math Kernel Library) implements BLAS, LAPACK, BLACS, ScaLAPACK
and FFT algorithms, as well as some interesting utility functions.</p>
<p>The commercial <a href="https://www.nag.com/content/nag-library">NAG
library</a> is a huge collection of algorithms for scientific
computing.</p>
