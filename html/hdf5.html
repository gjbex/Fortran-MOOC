<h1 id="hdf5">HDF5</h1>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>HDF5 is a very convenient file format for storing scientific data. It
combines the convenience of text files with the performance of binary
files.</p>
<p>An HDF5 can be viewed as a file system. The file can have groups
(directories) that can contain multiple data sets (files), hence the
name, Hierarchical Data Format. The file, its groups and data sets can
be annotated with meta-information, e.g., the units of the data.</p>
<p>Besides the raw data, datasets provide also meta-information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the name of the data set,</li>
<li>the data type of the values,</li>
<li>the dataspace, i.e., the rank and dimensions of the dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Datasets can have many different types, but broadly, they belong to
two categories: atomic and compound.</p>
<p>Some examples of atomic data types are floating point and integer
numbers, time, strings, bitfields and opaque. The latter can be used to
store binary objects such as JPEG or TIFF images.</p>
<p>Compound data types are arrays, variable length (1 dimensional array
of some data types), compound (similar to user defined types) and
enumerations.</p>
<p>One of the major advantages of HDF5 is that bindings are available
for most programming languages that are relevant in scientific
computing. A file generated by an application developed in a programming
language can be read by an application in a completely different program
language. Even better, HDF5 is platform independent.</p>
<p>HDF5 s a very nice data format for HPC applications since it supports
parallel I/O on file systems such as Lustre or IBM Spectrum Scale. This
allows multiple threads or processes of an application to perform I/O
operations in parallel.</p>
<p>HDF5 has excellent support for partial reads or writes of datasets
through hyperslabs. You can view a hyperslab as subarray in Fortran, or
slices in other programming languages. Unfortunately, using hyperslabs
requires a considerable number of lines of code, and is out of scope for
this course.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>Using HDF5 requires considerable effort. Here, you will get an
overview of writing data to an HDF5 file, examples of reading data are
provided as well.</p>
<h3 id="initialization">Initialization</h3>
<p>The first step is to initialize the HDF5 Fortran interface. This
should be before any other HDF5 related operation.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer :: error
...
call h5open_f(error)</code></pre>
<h3 id="opening-a-file">Opening a file</h3>
<p>The next step is to open a file for reading, writing or appending.
For instance, the following code snippet opens a file for writing,
replacing an existing file if that exists.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer(kind=hid_t) :: file_id
character(len=1024) :: file_name
...
call h5fcreate_f(file_name, H5F_ACC_TRUNC_F, file_id, error)</code></pre>
<p>The argument <code>file_id</code> has intent out, and it will contain
the file identifier subsequently used for further file operations. Note
that HDF5 defines its own kinds for identifiers <code>hid_t</code>. Make
sure to use these kinds to avoid very unpleasant surprises.
<code>H5F_ACC_TRUNC_F</code> ensures that when a file with the given
name exists, it is truncated, i.e., replaced. Several other options are
available and can be found in the documentation.</p>
<p>Note the <code>f</code>-prefix in the procedure name: all
file-related procedures share this prefix. It is part of a consistent
naming convention.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-group">Creating a group</h3>
<p>Once the file has been opened for writing or modification, groups can
be created.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer(kind=hid_t) :: group_id
character(len=1024) :: group_name
...
call h5gcreate_f(file_id, group_name, group_id, error)</code></pre>
<p>Again, interaction with the new group will be through its identifier,
<code>group_id</code>. Note the <code>g</code>-prefix.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-dataspace">Creating a dataspace</h3>
<p>Before a dataset can be created, you first need to create the
dataspace. The rank and the dimensions of the dataset have to be
defined.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer(kind=hid_t) :: pos_dspace_id
integer, parameter :: pos_rank = 2, pos_space_rank = 3
integer, parameter :: nr_particles = 10
integer(hsize_t), dimension(pos_rank) :: pos_dim = [ pos_space_rank, &amp;
                                                     nr_particles ]
...
call h5screate_simple_f(pos_rank, pos_dim, pos_dspace_id, error)</code></pre>
<p>This creates a dataspace for rank 2 and dimensions \(3 \times 10\). Note the
<code>s</code>-prefix for the dataspace-related procedures, and the use
of the <code>hsize_t</code> kind for specifying dimensions.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-dataset">Creating a dataset</h3>
<p>A dataset can now be created, this requires a name, a dataspace and a
type.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer(kind=hid_t) :: pos_dset_id
character(len=1024) :: pos_dset_name
...
call h5dcreate_f(group_id, pos_dset_name, H5T_NATIVE_REAL, &amp;
                 pos_dspace_id, pos_dset_id, error)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>group_id</code> is used as the location for the dataset, so
the dataset will be in this group. The type is atomic,
<code>H5T_NATIVE_REAL</code>, so single precision in the format native
to the platform the application runs on. Note
the<code>d</code>-prefix.</p>
<h3 id="writing-data">Writing data</h3>
<p>Finally, data can be written to the dataset you just created.</p>
<p>~~~<del>fortran real(kind=sp), dimension(pos_space_rank,
nr_particles) :: pos … call h5dwrite_f(pos_dset_id, H5T_NATIVE_REAL,
pos, pos_dim, error)</del>~~</p>
<p>An entire two-dimensional array is writting by a single procedure
call.</p>
<h3 id="closing-up">Closing up</h3>
<p>Once all operations have been perofrmed on and HDF5 entity, it should
be closed. This is the case for datasets, dataspaces, groups and
files.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">call h5dclose_f(pos_dset_id, error)
call h5sclose_f(pos_dspace_id, error)
call h5gclose_f(group_id, error)
call h5fclose_f(file_id, error)</code></pre>
<p>When all HDF5 operations are completed, the Fortran HDF5 interface is
closed as well.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">call h5close_f(error)</code></pre>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2>
<p>As you’ve seen, working with HDF5 files in Fortran is quite labor
intensive and finicky. However, given the advantages of the data format,
it is well worth the investment.</p>
<p>This only scratched the surface of HDF5 features. If you are
interested to learn more about HDF5, the PRACE courses on the subject
are recommended.</p>
