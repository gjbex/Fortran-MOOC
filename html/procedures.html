<h1 id="functions-and-subroutines">Functions and subroutines</h1>
<p>Fortran has two types of procedures: functions and subroutines. The
functionality of the two is essentially the same, so it depends on the
usage which is most convenient.</p>
<p>Both are “subprograms” in the sense that they perform a computation
based on their input, the arguments to the procedure. For functions, the
result of that computation is returned, and can be used in an
expression. Subroutines on the other hand usually modify the arguments
that are passed to them.</p>
<p>Procedures help you to avoid copy/pasting code (Don’t Repeat
Yourself), but also to structure your code into subprograms.</p>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>You will use a function when you want the result of the computation
it does in an expression. Since Fortran has many built-in functions,
referred to as intrinsic functions, we will use one to illustrate the
typical use of a function.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real :: x, y, hypot
...
hypot = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
...</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>sqrt</code> is an intrinsic function that takes a
real or complex number as an argument and returns a real or complex
value, the square root of its argument.</p>
<p>Note: as opposed to C, C++, Java and Python, mathematical functions
are intrinsic to the language, no header files or modules need to be
included. This is of course due to Fortran’s primary focus: scientific
computing.</p>
<p>As in any programming language, you can define your own functions.
The general form is given below.</p>
<pre><code>function &lt;function name&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;) result(&lt;result name&gt;)
    implicit none
    &lt;argument declarations&gt;
    &lt;result declaration&gt;
    &lt;local variable declarations&gt;

    &lt;function statements&gt;
end function &lt;function name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If this is somewhat abstract, let’s make it concrete with the
definition of a function that computes the distance between two points
given by their x and y coordinates.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>function distance(x1, y1, x2, y2) result(d)
    implicit none
    real(kind=DP), intent(in) :: x1, y1, x2, y2
    real(kind=DP) :: d

    d = sqrt((x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2)
end function distance</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>distance</code> is the name of the function,
<code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>x2</code>, <code>y2</code> are
the names of the function arguments and <code>d</code> is the name of
the variable that will hold the result.</p>
<p>The declaration of the arguments states that they are
<code>real</code> numbers with kind <code>DP</code>. Also the intent of
the arguments is declared. This can be</p>
<ul>
<li><code>in</code>: the argument’s value in the caller will be used,
but not modified.</li>
<li><code>out</code>: the argument’s value in the caller will be
replaced by the function.</li>
<li><code>inout</code>: the argument’s value in the caller will be used,
but also updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, we need the values of the arguments passed to the
function to compute the distance, hence, the intent is <code>in</code>
for all arguments.</p>
<p>The result variable <code>d</code> is also declared as a
<code>real</code> variable of kind <code>DP</code>.</p>
<p>Note an important difference with many other programming languages
such as C, C++ or Java: you don’t see a return statement in the
function. The semantics of function return values in Fortran differs
from that in those languages. In those programming languages, the value
returned by the function is the value of the expression in the return
statement. The return statement also transfers control back to the
caller of the function.</p>
<pre class="c"><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
    return sqrt((x1 - x2)*(x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2)*(y1 - y2));
}</code></pre>
<p>Although Fortran has a return statement, you could say that it only
does half the work that it does in many other programming languages. It
only returns control back to the caller, i.e., it terminates execution
of the function. In Fortran, the return value of a function is
determined by the execution of the last assignment to the result
variable, so to <code>d</code> in our example.</p>
<p>That implies that an assignment to the result variable has to be made
in each execution path through the function. The function
<code>factorial</code> below for instance has issues.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>function factorial(n) result(fac)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    integer :: fac
    integer :: i
    
    if (n &gt;= 0) then
        fac = 1
        do i = 2, n
            fac = fac*i
        end do
    end if
end function factorial</code></pre>
<p>if the argument <code>n</code> is negative, no assignment is made to
the result variable <code>fac</code> which results in undefined
behavior.</p>
<p>You can define a function in a slightly different way as well,
although it is a bit less robust.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;result type&gt; function &lt;function name&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;)
    implicit none
    &lt;argument declarations&gt;
    &lt;local variable declarations&gt;

    &lt;function statements&gt;
end function &lt;function name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>In this form, you declare the return type of the function in the
function’s signature, and the return value will be assigned to the
function name. The function to compute the distance could also be
defined as follows.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>real(kind=DP) function distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)
    implicit none
    real(kind=DP), intent(in) :: x1, y1, x2, y2

    distance = sqrt((x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2)
end function distance</code></pre>
<p>Although functionally equivalent, this style of function declaration
is less robust to change. If you decide to rename the function, you
would have to modify all assignment statements as well, which can be
error-prone for complex functions.</p>
<h2 id="subroutines">Subroutines</h2>
<p>The second type of procedures in Fortran are subroutines. You could
view them as functions that don’t return a value. The definition of
subroutines is very similar to that of functions, except for the result
value, which subroutines don’t have by definition.</p>
<p>Fortran has a number of intrinsic subroutines as well, for example to
generate pseudo-random numbers.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real :: x
...
call random_number(x)
...</code></pre>
<p>In the code fragment above, the variable <code>x</code> will be
assigned a pseudo-random number drawn from a uniform distribution
between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Note the use of the keyword <code>call</code> required to call a
subroutine!</p>
<p>The general form of a subroutine definition is given below.</p>
<pre><code>subroutine &lt;subroutine name&gt;(&lt;argument list&gt;)
    implicit none
    &lt;argument declarations&gt;
    &lt;local variable declarations&gt;

    &lt;subroutine statements&gt;
end subroutines &lt;subroutines name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can see an example of a subroutine definition below.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>subroutine clamp(val, min_val, max_val)
    implicit none
    real(kind=DP), intent(inout) :: val
    real(kind=DP), intent(in) :: min_val, max_val

    if (val &lt; min_val) then
        val = min_val
    else if (max_val &lt; val) then
        val = max_val
    end if
end subroutine clamp</code></pre>
<p>The subroutines takes three arguments, the first is <code>val</code>,
the value of interest. If it is less than the second argument,
<code>min_val</code> then it is set to the value of
<code>min_val</code>. If it is greater than the second argument,
<code>max_val</code> it is set to the value of <code>max_val</code>.
Otherwise, it is left unchanged.</p>
<p>This is also an illustration of the intent <code>inout</code>. The
argument <code>val</code>’s value is required in the if statements, but
can be modified by the subroutine as well.</p>
<p>The subroutines <code>clamp</code> could be used as in the code
fragment below.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real(kind=DP) :: x
...
call clamp(x, 0.0, 1.0)
...</code></pre>
<h2 id="call-by-value-or-call-by-reference">Call-by-value or
call-by-reference?</h2>
<p>A programming language such as C has call-by-value semantics. If a
variable is passed as an argument to a function, its value is passed and
assigned to the function’s local variable. Changing that local variable
doesn’t change the value of the variable in the caller’s context.</p>
<p>If you would do the same in Fortran, the value of the variable in the
caller’s context will be changed, Fortran has call-by-reference
semantics. The following program illustrates this.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>program call_by_reference
    implicit none
    integer :: m
    m = 5
    print *, m
    call increment(m)
    print *, m

contains

    subroutine increment(n)
        implicit none
        integer, intent(inout) :: n

        n = n + 1
    end subroutine increment

end program call_by_reference</code></pre>
<p>When you run this application, the output will be</p>
<pre><code>           5
           6</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>m</code> was passed to the subroutine
<code>increment</code> and modified in it. The intent of the argument is
<code>inout</code>, the original value is used to compute the new value,
which changes the value of <code>m</code> in the calling context.</p>
<p>If you would try to call <code>increment</code> with an integer
constant as an argument, i.e., <code>call increment(16)</code> you would
get a compilation error as</p>
<pre><code>    8 |     call increment(16)
      |                   1
Error: Non-variable expression in variable definition context (actual argument to INTENT = OUT/INOUT) at (1)</code></pre>
<p>Indeed, it doesn’t make sense to call a subroutine that has an
<code>inout</code> argument with a constant.</p>
<p>However, clearly, there are situations in which you would prefer
call-by-value semantics. Consider the following implementation of the
factorial function.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>function factorial(arg) result(fac)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: arg
    integer :: fac, n

    n = arg
    fac = 1
    do while (n &gt; 1)
        fac = fac*n
        n = n - 1
    end do
end function factorial</code></pre>
<p>The code above is a little clunky. On the one hand, we should ensure
that the argument <code>arg</code> is not modified, so it has intent
<code>in</code>, but on the other hand, it implies we have to introduce
a local variable <code>n</code> that is initialized with the value of
<code>arg</code>, but can be modified.</p>
<p>We can get the best of both worlds by using call-by-value semantics,
i.e., declaring that the argument is passed by value, as in the code
below.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>    function factorial(n) result(fac)
        implicit none
        integer, value :: n
        integer :: fac

        fac = 1
        do while (n &gt; 1)
            fac = fac*n
            n = n - 1
        end do
    end function factorial</code></pre>
<p>Although the argument <code>n</code> is modified in the function, it
is not modified in the calling context.</p>
<h2 id="recursion-procedures">Recursion procedures</h2>
<p>In most programming languages, functions can be recursively defined,
i.e., they have a call to themselves in their definition. Fortran allows
recursive procedures, but they have to be declared as such. For
instance, revisiting the example in the precious section we can define
that recursively as well.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>recursive function factorial(n) result(fac)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    integer :: fac

    if (n &gt;= 2) then
        fac = n*factorial(n - 1)
    else
        fac = 1
    end if
end function factorial</code></pre>
<p>Please note that although it may be more convenient to formulate a
recursive algorithm, this will typically use more system resources and
have worse efficiency than its iterative counterpart. In fact, any
recursive algorithm can be converted into an iterative algorithm, see
for instance this <a href="https://blog.moertel.com/posts/2013-05-11-recursive-to-iterative.html">blog
post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="keyword-arguments">Keyword arguments</h2>
<p>Fortran supports keyword arguments, which can be very convenient when
you have procedures with multiple arguments. Consider the example of the
<code>clamp</code> subroutine we defined above. Do you remember the
signature? Perhaps you don’t, if so, keyword arguments can help, and
make your code easier to understand. You can call the subroutine as
follows.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real :: x
...
call clamp(min_val=0.0, max_val=1.0, val=x)
...</code></pre>
<p>Keyword arguments are labeled by the name of the procedure’s
argument, but they do not have to appear in the same order as in the
procedure’s signature. Just to remind you, the subroutine was defined
as:</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>subroutine clamp(val, min_val, max_val)
   ...
end subroutine clamp</code></pre>
<p>It is strongly recommended to use keyword arguments to make your code
easier to understand.</p>
<h2 id="optional-arguments">Optional arguments</h2>
<p>Arguments to procedures can be optional. Some extra code is required
because the procedure must check whether or not a value has been
provided in the procedure call.</p>
<p>For example, let’s revisit the <code>clamp</code> procedure and make
<code>min_val</code> optional.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>subroutine clamp(val, min_val, max_val)
    implicit none
    real(kind=DP), intent(inout) :: val
    real(kind=DP), value, optional :: min_val
    real(kind=DP), value :: max_val

    if (.not. present(min_val)) min_val = -max_val
    if (val &lt; min_val) then
        val = min_val
    else if (max_val &lt; val) then
        val = max_val
    end if
end subroutine clamp</code></pre>
<p>The subroutine can be called either with two, or three arguments.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real(kind=DP) :: value
...
call clamp(val=value, max_val=5.0_DP)
...</code></pre>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real(kind=DP) :: value
...
call clamp(val=value, min_val=0.0_DP, max_val=5.0_DP)
...</code></pre>
<h2 id="persistent-values">Persistent values</h2>
<p>In some cases, it can be useful to make values of local variables in
procedures persistent, so that they can be used in future calls. In C
and C++, you would do this by adding the keyword <code>static</code> to
the local variable declaration. In Fortran you can use
<code>save</code>.</p>
<p>The following example uses a uniform random number distribution to
generate numbers from a normal distribution. The algorithm actually
generates two random values, so the second one is stored for the next
call in the <code>save</code> variable <code>next_val</code>. The
variable <code>is_next_val</code> will be true when a value is
available, false when two new values need to be computed.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>function get_exp_rand() result(val)
    implicit none
    real :: val
    real, save :: next_val
    logical, save :: is_next_set = .false.
    real :: x, y, radius, factor

    if (is_next_set) then
        is_next_set = .false.
        val = next_val
    else
        do while (.not. is_next_set)
            call random_number(x) 
            call random_number(y) 
            x = 2.0*x - 1.0
            y = 2.0*y - 1.0
            radius = x**2 + y**2
            if (0.0 &lt; radius .and. radius &lt;= 1.0) exit
        end do
        factor = sqrt(-2.0*log(radius)/radius)
        val = x*factor
        next_val =y*factor
        is_next_set = .true.
    end if
end function get_exp_rand</code></pre>
<h2 id="pure-procedures">Pure procedures</h2>
<p>You can help the compiler to generate more efficient code by writing
pure procedures and marking them as such. A pure procedure is a function
or a subroutine that has no side effects.</p>
<p>More specifically, all non-pointer arguments must be of intent
<code>in</code>. For subroutines, all arguments must have their intent
specified as <code>in</code> or <code>inout</code>.</p>
<p>For procedures in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>no local variables can have the <code>save</code> attribute;</li>
<li>I/O and stop statement are not allowed;</li>
<li>it can not be recursive;</li>
<li>an internal procedure or a procedure that is passed as an argument
must be pure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following function can be declared pure.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>pure function factorial(n) result(fac)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    integer :: fac, i

    fac = 1
    do i = 2, n
        fac = fac*n
    end do
end function factorial</code></pre>
<p>A subroutine can also be marked as pure, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>pure subroutine clamp(val, min_val, max_val)
    implicit none
    real(kind=DP), intent(inout) :: val
    real(kind=DP), intent(in) :: min_val, max_val

    if (val &lt; min_val) then
        val = min_val
    else if (max_val &lt; val) then
        val = max_val
    end if
end subroutine clamp</code></pre>
<h2 id="intrinsic-procedures">Intrinsic procedures</h2>
<p>The Fortran specification defines a large number of procedures, both
functions and subroutines as part of the language. You already
encountered the <code>sqrt</code> function and the
<code>random_number</code> subroutine.</p>
<p>Many mathematical functions are implemented as intrinsic functions,
e.g.,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the absolute value <code>abs</code>, the complex conjugate
<code>conjg</code>, the square root function <code>sqrt</code> and the
modulo function <code>mod</code>;</li>
<li>the trigonometric functions <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>,
<code>tan</code> and their inverse <code>asin</code>, <code>acos</code>
and <code>atan</code>;</li>
<li>the hyper-trigonometric functions <code>sinh</code>,
<code>cosh</code>, <code>tanh</code> and their inverse
<code>asinh</code>, <code>acosh</code> and <code>atanh</code>;</li>
<li>the natural and base-10 logarithm <code>log</code> and
<code>log10</code> as well as the exponential function
<code>exp</code>;</li>
<li>Bessel functions of the first and second kind
<code>bessel_j0</code>, <code>bessel_j1</code>, <code>bessel_jn</code>,
<code>bessel_y0</code>, <code>bessel_y1</code>,
<code>bessel_yn</code>;</li>
<li>the gamma function <code>gamma</code>, the error function
<code>erf</code> and the complementary error function
<code>erfc</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these functions are elemental functions, so they can be applied
element-wise to arrays as well.</p>
<p>Several mathematical functions defined on vectors or matrices are
also part of the specification, e.g.,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the minimum and maximum value in an array: <code>min</code> and
<code>max</code>;</li>
<li>the sum and product of array elements: <code>sum</code> and
<code>product</code>;</li>
<li>counting the number of elements in an array that satisfy some
Boolean condition: <code>count</code>;</li>
<li>the Euclidean norm of an array <code>norm2</code>;</li>
<li>the transpose of a two-dimensional array
<code>transpose</code>;</li>
<li>the dot product between two arrays <code>dot_product</code> and the
product between two-dimensional arrays <code>matmul</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Functions such as <code>min</code>, <code>max</code> and similar take
optional arguments to restrict the operation to certain dimensions so
that you can compute a row or a column-wise sum. They also accept a mask
so that operations can be restricted to elements that satisfy some
Boolean condition.</p>
<p>Although it is very unlikely that anyone would argue that Fortran is
the ideal programming language for string manipulations, some intrinsic
procedures ease the pain, e.g.,</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the <code>trim</code> function will remove trailing blank characters
from a string;</li>
<li>the <code>index</code> function returns the position of a substring
in a string, while <code>scan</code> returns the position of a set of
characters in a string;</li>
<li>the function <code>verify</code> will return <code>.true.</code>
when all characters in a string belong to a given set of
characters;</li>
<li>the <code>repeat</code> function creates a string by repeating a
given string a number of times.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously this is not an exhaustive list of all the intrinsic
procedures defined in the Fortran specification, so it really pays off
to check what is available to avoid reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>You can find a list of intrinsic procedures <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Intrinsic-Procedures.html#Intrinsic-Procedures">implemented
by GCC</a>. Note that not all these procedures are standard Fortran,
some are GNU extensions. This is clearly indicated though.</p>
