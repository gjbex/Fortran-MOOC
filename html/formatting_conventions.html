<h1 id="formatting-conventions">Formatting conventions</h1>
<p>Historically, Fortran had two formatting styles. Prior to Fortran 90,
code had to be written in so-called fixed source form. Fortran 90
introduced free source form which is much more convenient. Here, we’ll
only use free format style, but add notes on fixed format once in a
while in case you’re interested.</p>
<h2 id="why-follow-formatting-conventions">Why follow formatting
conventions?</h2>
<p>Each programming language has its own conventions of how to format
source code, and you may be familiar with those for C, C++, Java or
Python. Regardless, it is important to use those that are specific to
the programming language you are using. Doing so makes it easier for
other programmers familiar with Fortran to understand your code
quickly.</p>
<p>The one exception is when you work in a team or on a code base that
has established its own set of formatting rules, in that case, follow
those.</p>
<p>The motivation is the same: programming is storytelling, the story
should be easy to follow. The bottom line is: <em>be
consistent!</em></p>
<h2 id="use-upper-case-or-lower-case">Use upper case or lower case?</h2>
<p>Fortran is not case sensitive, so <code>SUBROUTINE</code> is the same
as <code>subroutine</code>. There is empirical evidence that lowercase
words are easier to read than uppercase, so the choice is easy.</p>
<p>In some text books, you will see Fortran keywords such as
<code>if</code>, ’end if<code>or</code>subroutine` rendered in upper
case, as opposed to variable names, procedure names and so on. We will
not use this convention here.</p>
<p>The one exception is for the names of constants, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>integer, parameter :: NR_PARTICLES = 1000</code></pre>
<h2 id="do-you-have-to-use-indentation">Do you have to use
indentation?</h2>
<p>Yes, you do.</p>
<p>Indentation really helps to visualize the structure of your code, and
will make it easier to understand. Each nested block of code gets
indented by an additional level.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>integer function gcd(a, b)
    implicit none
    integer, intent(in) :: a, b
    integer :: x, y

    x = a
    y = b
    do while (x /= y)
        if (x &gt; y) then
            x = x - y
        else if (y &gt; x) then
            y = y - x
        end if
    end do
    gcd = x
end function gcd</code></pre>
<p>Opinions differ on how many space to use to indent a block of code.
Whatever number you pick, be consistent. Here, we will use 4 spaces.</p>
<p>Don’t use tabs for indentation, the width a tab is visually expanded
to depends on the settings of your editor, so what may seem nicely
indented to you may be gibberish to someone else if indentation by tabs
and spaces is mixed. And trust me, it will at some point.</p>
<p>Historical note: prior to Fortran 90 code had to be formatted in a
very specific way. The first five characters of each line would be
reserved for numerical labels, if required. The sixth character had to
be blank, unless that line was a continuation of a previous line. This
convention goes back to the days when code was written on punch
cards.</p>
<h2 id="should-i-stick-to-a-maximum-line-length">Should I stick to a
maximum line length?</h2>
<p>The Fortran specification states that the maximum line length for
free source form is 132 characters. Although many compilers will accept
longer lines of code, you should nevertheless respect the
specification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can be convenient to limit the line length in
practice to fit in a 80 column terminal window. This is the convention
that will be followed in the code examples presented here.</p>
<p>The Fortran syntax is pretty strict about what should go on a line,
and doesn’t allow to break lines arbitrarily. For instance, consider the
following code.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>if (0.0 &lt;= x_coord .and. x_coord &lt;= X_MAX .and.
    0.0 &lt;= y_coord .and. y_coord &lt;= Y_MAX) then
    ...
end if</code></pre>
<p>If you would try to compile this code, the compiler would report a
syntax error. The if-statement should be on a single line. However, that
would make the code harder to read, and the number of characters on a
line would potentially exceed the limit of 132.</p>
<p>You can indicate that a line will be continued on the next by using
the <code>&amp;</code> character at the end. So the code fragment above
would compile when ‘&amp;’ is added to the first line.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>if (0.0 &lt;= x_coord .and. x_coord &lt;= X_MAX .and. &amp;
    0.0 &lt;= y_coord .and. y_coord &lt;= Y_MAX) then
    ...
end if</code></pre>
<p>Optionally, the line that continues a previous line can also start
with an <code>&amp;</code> character, i.e.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>if (0.0 &lt;= x_coord .and. x_coord &lt;= X_MAX .and. &amp;
  &amp; 0.0 &lt;= y_coord .and. y_coord &lt;= Y_MaX) then
    ...
end if</code></pre>
<p>Although we will typically not use this feature since it makes the
code harder to read, there is one case where it is actually very
useful.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>character(len=120) :: message = 'Warning: the number of&amp;
                               &amp; characters exceeds the prefered&amp;
                               &amp; limit.'</code></pre>
<p>Here, the string would be</p>
<pre><code>Warning: the number of characters exceeds the prefered limit.</code></pre>
<p>The spaces preceding the <code>&amp;</code> on the continuation lines
are ignored in the value of the string.</p>
<p>Historical note: fixed source form restricted the maximum line length
to 72 characters. again, this was a limitation due to the use of punch
cards. To indicate that a line is a continuation of a previous line, you
would use a non-zero character in the sixth column.</p>
<h2 id="how-should-i-use-white-space">How should I use white space?</h2>
<p>Using white space appropriately can make your code easier to read.
The general advise is to use white space as you would in written English
and mathematics.</p>
<p>For example, commas should be followed by a space, keywords and
parentheses should be separated by a space. Operands and operators
should be separated by a space.</p>
<p>Compare the following code</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>if (0.0 &lt; x) then
    y = f(x, y)
end if</code></pre>
<p>with the following which is legal, but harder to read</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>if(0.0&lt;x)then
    y=f(x,y)
endif</code></pre>
