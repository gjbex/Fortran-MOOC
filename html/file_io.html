<h1 id="file-io">File I/O</h1>
<p>Up to this point we only discussed a very limited subset of Fortran’s
file I/O capabilities. You read about formatted sequential I/O to read
and write text files. However, Fortran can also read and write binary
files.</p>
<p>It also has two more access modes for I/O, direct and stream, which
each have their specific use cases.</p>
<p>Finally, you will also learn about the <code>inquire</code>statement
that can be used to obtain information on files.</p>
<h2 id="formatted-versus-unformatted-io">Formatted versus unformatted
I/O</h2>
<p>Using formatted I/O has the advantage that files are human readable.
You can open them in a text editor or inspect them using tools such as
<code>cat</code> or <code>less</code>.</p>
<p>However, there are some disadvantages as well.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>text files are typically larger than binary files that contain the
same information.</li>
<li>Formatted I/O requires converting data to a textual representation,
or vice versa. This has a performance impact, increasing the time
required for I/O.</li>
<li>When you convert a floating point value to a text representation you
write to a file, and subsequently convert that text representation back
to a floating point value when you read the file, these two floating
point values may not be identical.</li>
<li>It is very hard to do parallel I/O using text files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Programming languages support binary I/O, i.e., writing the actual
bit representation of data to a file. Fortran is no exception to this,
and the term used for this is unformatted I/O.</p>
<p>When comparing the performance of writing 200 million floating point
values to a file, the difference between formatted and unformatted I/O
is quite interesting. The table below shows relative numbers.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>form</code></th>
<th>file size</th>
<th>walltime</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>'unformatted'</code></td>
<td>1.0</td>
<td>1.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>'formatted'</code></td>
<td>2.3</td>
<td>33.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The relative walltime difference depends of course on the file system
that is used, as well as the underlying hardware. The file size of the
formatted file depends on the format specifier that is used. This means
that in practice, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Using sequential unformatted I/O is straightforward. The open
statement is nearly identical to that of formatted I/O, i.e.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>open (newunit=unit_nr, file=file_name, form='unformatted', &amp;
      access='sequential', action='write', status='new', iostat=istat, &amp;
      iomsg=msg)</code></pre>
<p>The only difference is <code>form='unformatted'</code>. For the write
statement, the <code>fmt</code> argument is omitted, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>write (unit=unit_nr, iostat=istat, iomsg=msg) r, theta</code></pre>
<p>Similar for a read statement, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>read (unit=unit_nr, iostat=istat, iomsg=msg) r, theta</code></pre>
<p>You can write any combination of types to an unformatted file, but of
course, you would have to read it using the exact same data types. This
implies that the documentation of your binary file format is crucial.
Another potential disadvantage is that the binary representation of data
may differ from one hardware platform to the other.</p>
<p>As an alternative to unformatted I/O you may consider HDF5, a file
format we will discuss later that has many advantages.</p>
<h2 id="direct-access-io">Direct access I/O</h2>
<p>As the name implies, sequential I/O is, well, sequential. When you
read or write a file, you start at the beginning, and proceed towards
the end. This approach is quite suited to many use cases, but not all.
Consider for instance storing the results of computationally expensive
calculations in a file for future reference, either during the same run
of the application, or for later runs. If you can map compute the
position of the required result in the file, it would be if you could
simply read only that particular result, rather than starting at the
beginning of the file and having to read until the desired position was
reached.</p>
<p>Fortran supports direct access I/O, which is record-oriented. The
file can be considered as a sequence of records of identical type. A
read or write operation addresses a specific record in that file. The
records can be written or read in any order.</p>
<p>The following code fragment illustrates opening a file for direct
access formatted writing.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>open (newunit=unit_nr, file=trim(file_name), form='formatted', &amp;
      access='direct', recl=rec_width, action='write', status='new', &amp;
      iostat=istat, iomsg=msg)</code></pre>
<p>Note that access is <code>'direct'</code>, and that you have to
specify a fixed record length <code>recl</code> when you open the
file.</p>
<p>When a record is written, you have to specify its record ID.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>write (unit=unit_nr, fmt=fmt_str, rec=idx) idx, x</code></pre>
<p>The record ID is specified via the <code>rec</code> argument, and in
this example, each record consists of an integer and a real value.</p>
<p>As for sequential I/O, direct access I/O can be formatted or
unformatted.</p>
<p>You should realize that I/O subsystems, especially those on HPC
systems, are optimized for reading or writing data is is stored
consecutively on disk, so accessing data in some random order via direct
I/O will have a large impact on I/O performance. Only use direct access
I/O when it really fits your use case.</p>
<h2 id="stream-io">Stream I/O</h2>
<p>Besides sequential and direct access I/O, Fortran supports a third
I/O options. Both of these I/O types are essentially record-based, and
not compatible with files that have been created by non-Fortran
applications. Stream I/O is suitable for this use case.</p>
<p>For stream I/O, the unit of I/O is a byte, and this ensures that
files written by a Fortran application can be read by other
applications, or that a Fortran application can read binary data
produced by other applications.</p>
<p>Using stream I/O is straightforward as illustrated by the open
statement below and write statements below.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>open (newunit=unit_nr, file=file_name, form='unformatted', &amp;
      access='stream', action='write', status='new', iostat=istat, &amp;
      iomsg=msg)</code></pre>
<p>The access mode is <code>'stream'</code>.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>write (unit=unit_nr, iostat=istat, iomsg=msg) r, golden_spiral(r)</code></pre>
<p>The write statement as well as the read statement are identical to
those for sequential access.</p>
<p>The performance of stream I/O is better than that of sequential I/O,
and the file size is also smaller due to the lack of record terminators
in the resulting files.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><code>access</code></th>
<th>file size</th>
<th>walltime</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>'sequential'</code></td>
<td>1.5</td>
<td>1.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>'stream'</code></td>
<td>1.0</td>
<td>1.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As for all benchmarks, your mileage may vary depending on relative
record size and the characteristics of your file storage.</p>
<p>As for the other access types, stream I/O can be either formatted or
unformatted. However, formatted stream I/O is rarely used in
practice.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-information-on-files">How to get information on
files?</h2>
<p>The inquire statement can be used to retrieve information on files
and units.</p>
<p>For instance, you can use it to check whether a file named ‘data.txt’
exists.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>logical :: file_exists
...
inquire ('data.txt', exist=file_exists)

The following statement would retrieve the size in bytes of the file `data.txt`.

~~~~fortran
integer :: file_size
...
inquire ('data.txt', size=file_size)</code></pre>
<p>Based on the unit number, you can retrieve the file name. This can be
convenient to generated meaningful error message in procedures that only
get a unit number passed as argument.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>character(len=1024) :: file_name
...
inquire(unit=unit_nr, name=file_name)</code></pre>
<p>When doing stream I/O, the inquire statement can be used to determine
the current position in a file.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>integer :: position
...
inquire (unit=unit_nr, pos=position)</code></pre>
<p>This position can subsequently be used to reposition the read or the
write statement using the <code>pos</code> argument.</p>
<h2 id="io-performance">I/O performance</h2>
<p>In conclusion, for formatted I/O, sequential access is the most
convenient, while for unformatted I/O stream access yields the best
performance and interoperability. Still, sequential unformatted I/O may
be required if compatibility with other Fortran applications that use it
is required. Direct access I/O is only used when you require random
access to a file.</p>
<p>In general, it is best to read or write as much information as
possible in a single statement, so rather than iterating over the
elements of an array to write them to a file, write the entire array at
once.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>real, dimension(1000) :: x
integer :: stat
character(len=1024) :: msg
...
write (unit=unit_nr, iostat=stat, iomsg=msg) x</code></pre>
<p>Since the latency for file I/O are fairly high, the CPU is typically
not fully used while files are read or written. Fortran has features
that allow to overlap I/O operations and computations, i.e., while I/O
operations are in progress, the CPU can perform computations, using
asynchronous I/O.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-io">Asynchronous I/O</h2>
<p>To achieve overlap between I/O operations and computation, variables
can be declared <code>asynchronous</code>, <code>buffer</code> as shown
in the code fragment below. When opening a file, you have to specify
that you want to do asynchronous I/O. For instance, when an array
<code>buffer</code> is written to a file, the write statement should
have the <code>asynchronous</code> attribute. While the I/O operation
progresses, computations that do not modify the data that is currently
written can be executed, i.e., the array <code>buffer</code>.</p>
<p>Before changing the data in <code>buffer</code>, you would have to
check whether the I/O operation is still pending, and if so, you have to
wait until it is done. The inquire statement can be used to check this,
and the wait statement that will halt the execution until the
asynchronous I/O operation is completed.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>real, dimension(:), allocatable, asynchronous :: buffer
...
open (newunit=unit_nr, file=file_name, form='unformatted', &amp;
      asynchronous='yes', action='write', access='stream', status='replace', &amp;
      iostat=istat, iomsg=msg)
...
write (unit=unit_nr, asynchronous='yes', id=id1) buffer1
! computation that doesn't modify buffer
call do_some_heavy_computing(...)
inquire (unit=unit_nr, id=id2, pending=pending)
if (pending) wait(unit=unit_nr)
! computation that can modify buffer
call do_other_computations(...)
...</code></pre>
<p>The example above is for a write operation, but this applies equally
well to asynchronous read operations. The important point is that while
data is involved in an asynchronous I/O operation, that data should not
be modified for write operations, or used during read operations. The
inquire and wait statements are used to ensure this.</p>
<p>The performance improvement that you can achieve using asynchronous
I/O depends very strongly on the level of overlap that can be achieved,
and that depends in turn on the granularity of the I/O operations versus
the computations. Of course it makes no sense to invest time in
asynchronous I/O unless the I/O operations account for a considerable
fraction of the total walltime. You should profile your application to
determine this.</p>
