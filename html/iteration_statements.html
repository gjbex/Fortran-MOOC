<h1 id="iteration-statements">Iteration statements</h1>
<p>All programming languages have iteration statements, and so does
Fortran. It has two, the do statement intended to execute a block of
statements a number of times, and a while statement to execute a block
of statements for as long as a logical expression evaluates to true.</p>
<h2 id="do-statement">do statement</h2>
<p>The do statement will repeat a block of statements a number of times.
As a very simple example, consider the following program that computes
the factorial function for a number of integers. The general form is
given below.</p>
<pre><code>do &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt;, &lt;step&gt;
    &lt;statements&gt;
end do</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;variable&gt;</code> has to be of type
<code>integer</code>, while <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;end&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> should be integer
expressions. The <code>do</code> and <code>end do</code> delimit the
<code>&lt;statements&gt;</code> that will be repeated. In the first
iteration, <code>&lt;variable&gt;</code> will have the value
<code>&lt;start&gt;</code>, in the second iteration its value will be
<code>&lt;start&gt;</code> + <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> and so on till
the last iteration.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> is zero, the program will crash.</li>
<li>If <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> is positive and
<code>&lt;start&gt;</code> &gt; <code>&lt;end&gt;</code>, then the do
statement is not executed. Similarly, it will also not be executed if
<code>&lt;step&gt;</code> is negative, and <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>
&lt; <code>&lt;end&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the number of iterations is <code>&lt;nr_iter&gt;</code>
= (<code>&lt;end&gt;</code> - <code>&lt;start&gt;</code> +
<code>&lt;step&gt;</code>)/<code>&lt;step&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last iteration, <code>&lt;variable&gt;</code> will have the
value <code>&lt;start&gt;</code> + (<code>&lt;nr_iter&gt;</code> -
1)*<code>&lt;step&gt;</code>, and after the execution of the do
statement <code>&lt;variable&gt;</code> will have the value
<code>&lt;start&gt;</code> +
<code>&lt;nr_iter&gt;</code>*<code>&lt;step&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Here, the expression \(m/n\)
denotes the integer division.</p>
<p>The step needs not to be specified, and in that case will have the
default value 1.</p>
<pre><code>do &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt;
    &lt;statements&gt;
end do</code></pre>
<p>In the code below, there is a do statement in the program, and
another in the factorial function.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>program do_factorials
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: MAX_N = 10
    integer :: i

    do i = 1, MAX_N
        print *, i, factorial(i)
    end do

contains

    function factorial(n) result(fac)
        implicit none
        integer, intent(in) :: n
        integer :: fac
        integer :: i

        fac = 1
        do i = 2, n
            fac = fac*i
        end do
    end function factorial

end program do_factorials</code></pre>
<p>The do statement in the factorial function will only be executed when
its argument <code>n</code> is larger than 1.</p>
<p>Note that the number of iterations is fixed once the do statement
starts executing. The expressions for <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;end&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> are evaluated
once. If they would contain variables that are changed in the
<code>&lt;statements&gt;</code> of the loop, that will not change the
number of iterations.</p>
<p>Also note that modifying the iteration variable
<code>&lt;variable&gt;</code> by a statement in
<code>&lt;statemens&gt;</code> is forbidden. The compiler will report an
error. As a consequence, when you nest do statements, they should have a
different iteration variable.</p>
<h2 id="while-statement">while statement</h2>
<p>Fortranâ€™s second iteration statement is a while statement. Its
general form is given below.</p>
<pre><code>do while (&lt;logical expression&gt;)
    &lt;statements&gt;
end do</code></pre>
<p>Before the start of each iteration,
<code>&lt;logical expression&gt;</code> is evaluated. If it evaluates to
true, <code>&lt;statements&gt;</code> are executed, if it evaluates to
false, the iteration statement ends.</p>
<p>The function below computes the greatest common divisor of two
integer values. It will keep iterating as long as <code>a</code> is not
equal to <code>b</code>, computing and assigning new values to
<code>a</code> or <code>b</code> in each iteration.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>integer function gcd(a, b)
    implicit none
    integer, value :: a, b

    do while (a /= b)
        if (a &gt; b) then
            a = a - b
        else if (b &gt; a) then
            b = b - a
        end if
    end do
    gcd = a
end function gcd</code></pre>
<h2 id="equivalence-of-do-and-while-statements-versus-semantics">Equivalence
of do and while statements versus semantics</h2>
<p>In fact, any do statement can be converted to a while statement. The
general form of the do statement is given below.</p>
<pre><code>do &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;start&gt;, &lt;end&gt;, &lt;step&gt;
    &lt;statements&gt;
end do</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent while loop would be the following.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;variable&gt; = &lt;start&gt;
do while (&lt;variable&gt; &lt;= &lt;end&gt;)
    &lt;statements&gt;
    &lt;variable&gt; = &lt;variable&gt; + &lt;step&gt;
end do</code></pre>
<p>Here, we assume that <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> is positive. A similar
equivalence can be defined for negative values of
<code>&lt;step&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Obviously, the do statement conveys your intentions much better than
the while statement.</p>
<h2 id="infinite-loops-exit-and-cycle">Infinite loops, exit and
cycle</h2>
<p>Implementing an infinite loop, i.e., a loop statement that never
terminates is quite easy in Fortran.</p>
<pre><code>do
    &lt;statements&gt;
end do</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;statements&gt;</code> will continue to be executed
unless there is a stop or an exit statement in
<code>&lt;statements&gt;</code>. You might ask why anyone would want to
program an infinite loop on purpose. A few scenarios come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>programs that handle streams of data, e.g., parsers;</li>
<li>programs that handle events, e.g., network services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although their functionality can be accomplished using a while
statement, it is often quite cumbersome. You should realize that this is
a contentious statement that many will not agree with.</p>
<p>Infinite loops raise the obvious question whether you can still exit
them without terminating the application by the operating system. There
are two options, depending on what you want to accomplish that will
terminate any iteration statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>the stop statement would terminate the execution of the program,
and</li>
<li>the exit statement would terminate the execution of the do
statement, and continue executing the next statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following program illustrates both an infinite loop, and the use
of an exit statement. It reads floating point values from standard
input, and computes the sum. When there is no more input,
<code>stat</code> will have a negative value (end-of-file), and the
iteration statement is terminated using the <code>exit</code> statement.
The next statement prints the sum.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>program sum_values
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : input_unit
    implicit none
    real :: val, total
    integer :: stat

    total = 0.0
    do
        read (unit=input_unit, fmt=*, iostat=stat) val
        if (stat &lt; 0) exit
        if (stat &gt; 0) cycle
        total = total + val
    end do
    print *, total
end program sum_values</code></pre>
<p>This code also illustrates the cycle statement. Its semantics is that
it will start the next iteration, skipping all statements in the block
below it. In this case, <code>stat</code> will have a non-zero positive
value when the line that was read from standard input could not be
converted to a <code>real</code> value. If that is the case, the
assignment statement to the variable <code>total</code> will not be
executed.</p>
<p>Note that the following program would be equivalent, avoiding an
infinite loop, as well as exit and cycle statements.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>program sum_values
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : input_unit
    implicit none
    real :: val, total
    integer :: stat

    total = 0.0
    stat = 0
    do while (stat &gt;= 0)
        read (unit=input_unit, fmt=*, iostat=stat) val
        if (stat == 0) total = total + val
    end do
    print *, total
end program sum_values</code></pre>
<p>Arguably, the code in this version of the program is even cleaner
that the first one, but it will be hard to generalize to more complex
situations.</p>
<h2 id="named-blocks">Named blocks</h2>
<p>Fortran allows you to name block statements. This is illustrated in
the code fragment below.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>function has_duplicates(data) result(result)
    integer, dimension(:), intent(in) :: data
    logical :: result
    integer :: i, j

    result = .false.
    outer: do i = 1, size(data) - 1
        do j = i + 1, size(data)
            if (data(i) == data(j)) then
                result = .true.
                exit outer
            end if
        end do
    end do outer
end function has_duplicates</code></pre>
<p>This function checks whether an array contains duplicate elements. If
so, it returns <code>.true.</code>, otherwise <code>.false.</code>. If
there is a duplicate, this is detected in the inner do loop, and the
result is known. Hence you want to exit the outer do loop. Simply using
the exit statement would terminate the inner loop, but the outer loop
would continue with its next iteration.</p>
<p>However, we can give block statements a name, <code>outer</code> in
the example above. The name of the do loop can then be used in the exit
statement to specify which loop should be exited.</p>
<p>This is likely the most common application of named blocks, but since
names can be given to any block statement (do and do while loops, block
if statements, select, where, do concurrent, block. It may help to add
names to block statements to make code more readable and help the
compiler catch semantic errors.</p>
<p>The general form of a named block statement is:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;name&gt;: &lt;block-statement&gt; ...
    ...
end &lt;block-statement&gt; &lt;name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Using the <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> for ending the block is optional,
but may help you interpret your code more easily.</p>
<p>Note that the example is slightly contrived. In practice you would
likely use a return statement rather than an exit statement in this
situation.</p>
