<h1 id="random-numbers">Random numbers</h1>
<p>Fortran has intrinsic procedures for pseudo-random number generation.
You can easily generate a sequence of pseudo-random floating point
values from a uniform distribution in the half-closed interval \([0, 1[\). The start of the sequence is
determined by a seed, i.e., a state of the algorithm that changes each
time a random number is generated. This change of state is
deterministic, so starting from the same initial state or seed will get
you the exact same sequence of random numbers twice. This is the reason
these numbers are referred to as “pseudo-random”, rather than “random”,
although we will use the latter term for brevity anyway.</p>
<p>Random numbers play an important role in many scientific domains and
are in fact at the core of some key algorithms such as Monte Carlo
methods.</p>
<h2 id="generating-random-numbers">Generating random numbers</h2>
<p>The intrinsic subroutine <code>random_number</code> will give you a
random number or array of numbers each time it is called, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
real :: r
...
do i = 1, nr_vals
    call random_number(r)
    print '(F10.7)', r
end do
...</code></pre>
<p>Each time the subroutine <code>random_number</code> is called, it
assigns a new real value to <code>r</code> such that \(0 \le \textrm{r} &lt; 1\).</p>
<p>In the following code snippet, <code>coords</code> is an array of
double precision floating point values.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : DP =&gt; REAL64
...
real(kind=DP), dimension(3) :: coords
...
call random_number(coords)
...</code></pre>
<h2 id="random-number-generator-state">Random number generator
state</h2>
<p>The intrinsic subroutine <code>random_seed</code> serves several
purposes, depending on the optional arguments it is called with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>size</code>: the number of integer values that determine the
state of the random number generator; this is an argument with intent
<code>out</code>.</li>
<li><code>get</code>: the current state of the random number generator,
it is an array with a size at least equal to the <code>size</code> of
the state, this is an argument with intent <code>out</code> as
well.</li>
<li><code>put</code>: the new state of the random number generator, it
is an array with a size at least equal to the <code>size</code> of the
state, this is an argument with intent <code>in</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following code fragment determines the current state of the
random number generator.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
integer :: seed_size, istat
integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: seed_vals, new_seed_vals
...
call random_seed(size=seed_size)
allocate (seed_vals(seed_size), new_seed_vals(seed_size), stat=istat)
...
call random_seed(get=seed_vals)
print '(A, *(I12))', 'seeds: ', seed_vals
...</code></pre>
<p>We start by checking the required size for the seed of the random
number generator by calling <code>random_seed</code> using the optional
<code>size</code> argument. Next, we allocate an integer array of that
size to store the values of the state which we obtain by calling
<code>random_seed</code> again with the <code>get</code> argument.</p>
<p>Note that the size of the state is implementation dependent, e.g.,
for GCC 10.x the size is 8, while for Intel’s ifort 18.x it is 2. This
is something to take into account when relying on random numbers in
Fortran.</p>
<h2 id="why-seed">Why seed?</h2>
<p>The Fortran runtime will seed the random number generator
automatically for you so that you get a different sequence of random
numbers each time you call the application. Very often this is exactly
what you want, but not always.</p>
<p>There are circumstances in which you want to make sure that each run
of your application produces exactly the same sequence of random
numbers. Imagine debugging an application for which a bug is triggered
or not, depending on a random value: good luck to you!</p>
<p>Another use case for seeding the random number generator is in the
context of testing your application. To be reliable, tests often need to
be deterministic. Sometimes you want to be able to exactly reproduce a
previous run of your application for performance tuning.</p>
<p>A more subtle use case arises in the context of parallel programming.
Since the seeding of the random number generator by the Fortran runtime
is a black box, it may be based on the value of the system clock. If
that is the case, and many processes start nearly simultaneously, two or
more processes may have the same seed. In such a setting that is
typically not what you want since the random sequences of the processes
should be independent.</p>
<p>Note: just to be very clear on this point, typically you seed the
random number generator once when your application starts.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-seed">How to seed?</h2>
<p>When you initialize an array of the appropriate size (obtained by a
call to <code>random_seed</code> with the <code>size</code> argument,
you can use that to seed the random number generator.</p>
<p>For debugging purposes you could seed the random number generator in
a fairly trivial way as follows.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
integer :: seed_size, istat
integer, dimension(:), allocatable :: seed_vals
...
call random_seed(size=seed_size)
allocate (seed_vals(seed_size), stat=istat)
...
seed_vals = 42
...</code></pre>
<p>A better approach is to store the seed values in a file, and read
them to initialize the array of seed values.</p>
<h2 id="best-practice">Best practice</h2>
<p>Your application can be configured to use a file containing seed
values when given. If not, it will write the seed values selected by the
Fortran runtime to a file with a timestamp in its name, so that it is
unique. This file can later be used to reproduce the specific run of the
application.</p>
<p>A little more care is required in the context of parallel
applications, but the same approach can be used.</p>
<p>Fortran’s intrinsic random number generator is fairly limited in
scope. You would have to write your own code to sample from a
non-uniform distribution or over a different numeric domain.</p>
