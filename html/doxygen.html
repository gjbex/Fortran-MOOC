<h1 id="documentation-using-doxygen">Documentation using Doxygen</h1>
<p>Writing proper documentation is an integral part of software
development that is sadly often neglected. It is often perceived as a
chore, but keeping documentation up-to-date and in sync with your code
need not be hard or tedious. Doxygen is a very nice tool to generate
professional looking documentation. It can be used for software projects
developed in many programming langauges, including Fortran.</p>
<p>Writing API (Application Programming Interface) documentation simply
boils down to adding comments to a procedure that mentions</p>
<ul>
<li>its intent,</li>
<li>a description,</li>
<li>its arguments, including the type and semantics,</li>
<li>its return type, if any.</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation at the level of modules can be added as comments as
well.</p>
<p>The doxygen tool will read the source code, extract the documentation
and render it as HTML or LaTeX. The latter can easily be turned into a
PDF document. Doxygen integrates nicely with CMake, hence the generation
of documentation is part of your build process.</p>
<p>Doxygen is quite sophisticated and offer many features and
opportunities for custimization that are beyond the scope of this
introduction. Here you will see how to document your code and how to
generate an HTML version of it.</p>
<p>Doxygen provides a number of special commands such as
<code>@brief</code>, <code>@param</code> and <code>@returns</code> to
make it easier to render documentation consistently. For the description
you can use Markdown, while formulas can be written in LaTeX.</p>

<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">!&gt; @brief read x, y coordinates from standard input
!&gt;
!&gt; This subroutine reads a pair of x and y coordinates from standard input. It
!&gt; will verify that the input format is correct.  The application will stop if
!&gt; that is not the case (exit code 3).  If there is no more input, this will be
!. conveyed via the `istat` argument.

!&gt; @param[out] y coordinate

<p>The <code>@brief</code> entry is intended for a brief description of
the procedure. This can (optionally) be followed by a longer description
of one or more paragraphs. The arguments’ intent (<code>in</code>,
<code>out</code>, <code>inout</code>) and description can be specified
using <code>@param</code>. For functions, you can use
<code>@return</code> to describe the result.</p>
<p>Note that you don’t have to specify the types of the arguments and
return value since doxygen is smart enough to figure that out from the
procedure definition itself.</p>

!&gt; the points (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1).  A command line argument
!&gt; specifies the resolution of the boxes, e.g., 2 means that 4 boxes

  @brief program that computes the Minkowski dimension of a 2D fractal
  @author Geert Jan Bex (geertjan.bex@uhasselt.be)
  
  This program computes the Minkowski fractal dimension for two dimensional objects
  using box counting.  It has the number of edges as a command line parameter.
  If the number of edges is $n$, a total of $n^2$ boxes is used to count the points.

  Points of the 2D objects are read from standard input in text representation
  as x-y coordinates.

  Example usage if the points are read from file `data.txt`:</code></pre>

<p>The generated HTML documentation is fully hyperlinked and
searchable.</p>
<p>This file, <code>mainpage.dox</code> is stored in the
<code>docs</code> directory, together with the configuration
template.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Doxygen can be configured on a per project basis. It has many
configuration options so the easiest way to get started is to let
doxygen generate a template configuration file that you adapt to your
needs.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code class="language-fortran">$ doxygen  -g</code></pre>
<p>There are a number of configuration options you definitely want to
set such as</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PROJECT_NAME</code>: the name of your project;</li>
<li><code>PROJECT_NUMBER</code>: the version number of your
project;</li>
<li><code>PROJECT_BRIEF</code>: a brief description of the project;</li>
<li><code>OUTPUT_DIRECTORY</code>: when using CMake, this would be
<code>@CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR@/doc_doxygen/</code>;</li>
<li><code>OPTIMIZE_FOR_FORTRAN</code>: you want to set this to
<code>YES</code>;</li>
<li><code>EXTENSION_MAPPING</code>: depending on the file name
extensions you use, you can add what you require, e.g.,
<code>f90=FortranFree</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other settings are typically fine by default.</p>
<p>When you want CMake to generate the documentation as part of the
build process, this configuration file is best saved in a directory
called <code>docs</code> and named <code>Doxyfile.in</code>.</p>
<h2 id="cmake-doxygen">CMake &amp; doxygen</h2>
<p>CMake can generate the documentation when you build your software,
and this was already assumed in the previous section. The fragment of
the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> responsible for this is shown below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fortran">option(BUILD_DOC "Build documentation" ON)

# check if Doxygen is installed
find_package(Doxygen)
if (DOXYGEN_FOUND)
    # set input and output files
    set(DOXYGEN_IN ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/docs/Doxyfile.in)
    set(DOXYGEN_OUT ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile)

    # request to configure the file
    configure_file(${DOXYGEN_IN} ${DOXYGEN_OUT} @ONLY)
    message("Doxygen build started")

    # note the option ALL which allows to build the docs together with the application
    add_custom_target( doc_doxygen ALL
        COMMAND ${DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE} ${DOXYGEN_OUT}
        WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}
        COMMENT "Generating API documentation with Doxygen"
        VERBATIM )
else (DOXYGEN_FOUND)
    message("Doxygen need to be installed to generate the doxygen documentation")
endif (DOXYGEN_FOUND)</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the <code>Doxyfile.in</code> is first configured
using the information for the current build and transformed into
<code>Doxyfile</code> in the binary directory. Moreover, a custom target
<code>doc_doxygen</code> is added for generating the documentation.</p>
<p>When you use CMake to build your application, the HTML and LaTeX
documentation will be generated in the <code>doc_doxygen</code>
subdirectory of the build directory.</p>
