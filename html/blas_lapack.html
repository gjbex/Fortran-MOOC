<h1 id="blas-and-lapack">BLAS and LAPACK</h1>
<p>Matrix computations and linear algebra are some of the most basic
building blocks of may scientific software applications. Often, the
performance of these core algorithms determine the performance and
efficiency of your code.</p>
<p>BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) is a library specification
that implements various operations on vectors and matrices. It was
originally published in 1979. There are many implementations such as the
reference implementation from netlib, OpenBLAS and Intel MKL (Math
Kernel Library). It is quite important with respect to performance to
select a well-optimized implementation for your platform. Typically
OpenBLAS (open source) and Intel MKL (commercial) will give the best
performance. BLAS defines three classes of algorithms, BLAS level 1, 2
and 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>BLAS Level 1: operations on vectors, e.g., scalar product, scaling,
Givens rotation;</li>
<li>BLAS Level 2: matrix-vector operations, e.g., matrix-vector product,
solving a triangular equation;</li>
<li>BLAS level 3: matrix-matrix operations, e.g., matrix-matrix
products.</li>
</ul>
<p>For several operations implementations for special types of matrices
are available (triangular matrices, symmetric matrices, band matrices).
The specification supports single and double precision real and complex
floating point numbers.</p>
<p>Whereas BLAS provides basic linear algebra operations on vectors and
matrices, you will typically turn to LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) for
more sophisticated algorithms. Just as for BLAS, netlib provides a
reference implementation that has been optimized in various library
implementations such as OpenBLAS and Intel MKL.</p>
<p>LAPACK defines algorithms to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors, solve
linear equations, perform linear regression, as well as a wide selection
of matrix decomposition algorithms. As for BLAS, algorithms are
implemented for both single and double precision real floating point
numbers, and complex numbers when appropriate.</p>
<p>Under the hood, LAPACK algorithms are often implemented using BLAS
procedures, so it is required to have BLAS installed when you want to
use LAPACK, and very highly recommended to have a well-optimized
implementation if you want LAPACK to perform efficiently.</p>
<p>You will notice that the names of procedures (mostly subroutines) are
fairly cryptic, e.g., <code>dgemm</code>. The latter is a double
precision (<code>d</code>) general (<code>ge</code>) matrix
(<code>m</code>)-matrix (<code>m</code>) multiplication. The reason for
such names is historical. Names for procedures were restricted to 6
characters at the time.</p>
<p>The elements of the vectors and matrices can be single precision real
numbers (<code>s</code>), double precision real numbers
(<code>d</code>), single precision complex numbers (<code>c</code>) and
double precision complex numbers (<code>z</code>).</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-blas-and-lapack">Advantages of BLAS and
LAPACK</h2>
<p>Although the problems solved by the BLAS library seem fairly simple,
the algorithms that implement them are the result of decades of research
and painstaking optimizations. Good implementations will use vector
instructions that get every drop of efficiency out of advanced CPU
design. They have also been written to take advantage of multiple cores,
so your code automatically executes in parallel, typically using OpenMP
under the hood.</p>
<p>LAPACK is implemented on top of BLAS, and hence will benefit from the
optimization and parallelization of that library as well.</p>
<h2 id="blas">BLAS</h2>
<p>BLAS defines a large number (more than 120) of procedures, so we will
just discuss a few of them so that you get the flavor of how to use the
library. You will see one or more examples of each BLAS level.</p>
<h3 id="blas-level-1-vector-operations">BLAS level 1: vector
operations</h3>
<p>Level 1 operation are defined on vectors. For example, the subroutine
<code>dcopy</code> will copy a double precision array (<code>d</code>)
to another double precision array.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real(kind=DP), dimension(rows, cols) :: matrix1, matrix2
...
call dcopy(size(matrix1), matrix1, 1, matrix2, 1)
...</code></pre>
<p>Note that although level 1 focuses on vector operations, you can use
this subroutine to copy data from a multidimensional array to another
multidimensional array, not necessarily of the same rank and
dimensions.</p>
<p>The signature of this subroutine is</p>
<pre><code>subroutine dcopy(&lt;N&gt;, &lt;DX&gt;, &lt;INCX&gt;, &lt;DY&gt;, &lt;INCY&gt;)</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>&lt;N&gt;</code> is the number of elements to copy,
typically the size of the array, <code>&lt;DX&gt;</code> is the array to
copy to <code>&lt;DY&gt;</code>. Usually, the values for
<code>&lt;INCX&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;INCY&gt;</code> (increment for
iterating over the elements of <code>&lt;DX&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;DY&gt;</code> respectively are 1, but they can be used
creatively in some situations.</p>
<p>Another very useful BLAS level 1 function is <code>sdot</code>, the
single precision dot product of two vectors, i.e., \(
   d = \sum_{i=1}^{N} u_i v_i
\)</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real, dimension(v_size) :: vector1, vector2
real :: product
real, external :: sdot
...
product = sdot(size(vector1), vector1, 1, vector2, 1)
...</code></pre>
<p>This is a function that returns a <code>real</code> value and takes
arguments that have similar semantics as those of
<code>dcopy</code>.</p>
<p>Some other noteworthy procedures are available for normalization,
scaling and especially a combined multiply-add that is very common in
scientific algorithms, i.e., \(
    \vec{y} = \vec{y} + \alpha \vec{x}
\)</p>
<p>Note that BLAS functions need to be declared as
<code>external</code>.</p>
<h3 id="blas-level-2-matrix-vector-operations">BLAS level 2:
matrix-vector operations</h3>
<p>An example of a level 2 operation is a matrix-vector product. For
instance, <code>sgemv</code> implements the product of a single
precision real general matrix and a vector. To be more precise, the
result is given by: \(
    \vec{y} = \alpha A \vec{x} + \beta \vec{y}
\) or \(
    \vec{y} = \alpha A' \vec{x} + \beta \vec{y},
\) depending on the first argument given to <code>sgemv</code>.
The signature of the subroutine is</p>
<pre class="fortan"><code>subroutine sgemv(&lt;TRANS&gt;, &lt;M&gt;, &lt;N&gt;, &lt;alpha&gt;, &lt;A&gt;, &lt;LDA&gt;, &lt;x&gt;, &lt;INCX&gt;, &lt;beta&gt;, &lt;y&gt;, &lt;INCRY&gt;)</code></pre>
<p>The value of <code>&lt;TRANS&gt;</code> can be <code>'t'</code> or
<code>'c'</code> to transpose or take the complex conjugate from
<code>&lt;A&gt;</code> respectively, or <code>'n'</code> to use
<code>&lt;A&gt;</code> as is. <code>&lt;M&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;N&gt;</code> are the number of rows and columns of
<code>&lt;A&gt;</code> respectively. <code>&lt;A&gt;</code> is a single
precision real two-dimensional array. <code>&lt;LDA&gt;</code> is the
number of rows of <code>&lt;A&gt;</code>. <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;y&gt;</code> are single precision real one-dimensional arrays.
<code>&lt;INCX&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;INCY&gt;</code> are typically
equal to 1. <code>&lt;alpha&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;beta&gt;</code> are
single precision real values. If <code>&lt;beta&gt;</code> is zero,
<code>&lt;y&gt;</code> does not need to be initialized.</p>
<p>Specific implementation of this operation are defined for special
cases for \(A\), e.g., when \(A\) is a banded, symmetric, symmetric
banded or triangular matrix.</p>
<p>There are a few other useful level 2 operations such as solving a
triangular set of equations and performing a symmetric rank 1 and rank 2
operation, i.e.,</p>
<p>\(
    A = \alpha \vec{x} \otimes \vec{x}' + A
\)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>\(
    A = \alpha ( \vec{x} \otimes \vec{y}' + \vec{y} \otimes
\vec{x}' ) + A
\)</p>
<p>respectively.</p>
<h3 id="blas-level-3-matrix-matrix-operations">BLAS level 3:
matrix-matrix operations</h3>
<p>Matrix-matrix multiplication is implemented by level 3 operations for
general, symmetric and triangular matrices. For instance,
<code>sgemm</code> implements a matrix-matrix multiplication for
two-dimensional real arrays with single precision values.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real, dimension(M, K) :: A
real, dimension(K, N) :: B
real, dimension(M, N) :: C
real :: alpha, beta
...
call sgemm('n', 'n', M, N, K, alpha, A, K, B, N, beta, C, M)
...</code></pre>
<p>The first two arguments specify which operation should be performed
on the matrices <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> respectively. This can
be <code>'n'</code> (none), <code>'t'</code> (transpose) or
<code>'c'</code> conjugate complex. The sizes of the matrices are given
next, <code>A</code> is an <code>M</code> by <code>K</code> matrix,
<code>B</code> is <code>K</code> by <code>N</code> and <code>C</code> is
<code>M</code> by <code>N</code>. The operation performed is \(
    C = \alpha \textrm{op}(A) \cdot \textrm{op}(B) + \beta C
\)</p>
<p>Other operations implemented in the level 3 BLAS library rank-\(k\) symmetric updates, and solving sets of
triangular linear equations with multiple right-hand sides.</p>
<h2 id="lapack">LAPACK</h2>
<p>LAPACK implements some widely used algorithms for linear algebra,
e.g., for solving sets of linear equations, linear least square methods,
eigenvalue problems, singular value decomposition and matrix
factorization. Like BLAS, it has implementations for real and complex
matrices, single and double precision.</p>
<p>LAPACK is available under an open source BSD license, but Intelâ€™s MKL
library offers an implementation as well. Since LAPACK is built on top
of BLAS, its performance depends critically on that of the BLAS library
implementation.</p>
<p>The naming of LAPACK procedures is similar to BLAS in that the name
of a procedure indicates both the type of data in the matrices (real or
complex, single or double precision) and the type of matrix (general,
bidiagonal, symmetric and so on). The name ends with a one to three
letter identification of the algorithm. For instance,
<code>sgesvd</code> would be a singular value decomposition
(<code>svd</code>) of a general (<code>ge</code>) single precision
(<code>s</code>) matrix.</p>
<p>It would lead us too far to go into all the algorithms implemented in
LAPACK, so we will just present some examples.</p>
<h3 id="solving-sets-of-linear-equations">Solving sets of linear
equations</h3>
<p>Solving a set of \(n\) linear
equations in \(n\) unknowns, given by
\(A \cdot X = B\) where \(A\) is an \(n
\times n\) matrix and \(X\) and
\(B\) are \(n \times m\) matrices. If \(m &gt; 1\), the algorithms will solve
\(m\) sets of equations.</p>
<p>For general single precision real matrices <code>A</code> and
<code>B</code>, the subroutine is <code>sgesv</code>. In the code below,
<code>n_matrix</code> represents the number of rows and columns of \(A\), and <code>nr_rhs</code> the number of
columns of <code>B</code> which has <code>n_matrix</code> rows. Under
the hood, the algorithm uses LU factorization, so a one-dimensional
integer array of size <code>n_matrix</code> matrix is required to store
the permutation indices.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>call sgesv(n_matrix, nr_rhs, A, n_matrix, P, B, n_matrix, info)</code></pre>
<p>The arrays <code>A</code>,<code>B</code> and <code>P</code> have been
declared in the usual way, and <code>info</code> will contain the status
after the call, 0 if the algorithm succeeded, a negative value
represents the index of an illegal argument passed to <code>sgesv</code>
and a positive value indicates that there is no solution.</p>
<p>The solution is stored in the array <code>B</code>, so that will
contain the values of \(X\). The
original array <code>A</code> will be overwritten by the \(U\) and \(L\) matrices of the LU factorization.</p>
<p>For more information on LU factorization, you can consult a good text
book on applied linear algebra, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h3 id="singular-value-decomposition">Singular value decomposition</h3>
<p>The singular value decomposition of an \(m
\times n\) matrix \(M\) is
given by \(U \cdot \Sigma \cdot
V^{*}\). Here \(U\) is an \(m \times m\) matrix and \(V\) is \(n
\times n\) matrix, both unitary and their columns form an
orthogonal basis. The matrix \(\Sigma\) is a diagonal \(m \times n\) matrix with non-negative
elements. The LAPACK implementation returns these in descending order.
If \(M\) is real-valued, so are \(U\) and \(V\), and \(V^*
= V^t\).</p>
<p>You can find more information about singular value decomposition and
its applications in any good book on numerical methods but for a quick
introduction <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">Wikipedia</a>
will serve.</p>
<p>By way of example, we will consider the <code>sgesvd</code>
subroutine to compute the singular value decomposition of a general
single precision real matrix. The arrays <code>M</code>, <code>U</code>
and <code>VT</code> are declared as you would expect. The number of rows
of <code>M</code> is <code>nr_rows</code>, its number of columns is
<code>nr_cols</code>. Since \(\Sigma\)
is a diagonal matrix, it is represented as a one-dimensional array
<code>S</code> with a size that is the minimum of the number of rows and
columns of <code>M</code> so as not to waste memory.</p>
<p>The implementation of the SVD algorithm requires working space that
can be determined by a call to the <code>sgesvd</code> subroutine with
the argument representing the size of the work array set to -1. The work
array should have at least size 1 at that point to accommodate the
required size as a result of the call. It is convenient to use an
allocatable array so that it can be sized dynamically as required.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>real, dimension(:), allocatable :: work
integer :: work_size, info, istat
...
allocate(work(1))
info = 0
call sgesvd('A', 'A', nr_rows, nr_cols, M, nr_rows, S, &amp;
            U, nr_rows, VT, nr_cols, work, -1, info)
work_size = int(work(1)) + 1
allocate(work(work_size), stat=istat)</code></pre>
<p>Most of these arguments are self-explanatory, the first two indicate
what should be returned in the matrices <code>U</code> and
<code>VT</code>. <code>'A'</code> means that all columns should be
returned. You can read <code>sgesvd</code>â€™s documentation for other
options.</p>
<p>The argument <code>info</code> will be set to 0 upon success. A
negative value indicates the index of an illegal argument to
<code>sgesvd</code>, a positive value signals that the algorithm did not
converge (relevant only for the second call to <code>sgesvd</code>).</p>
<p>After this preparatory step, the actual work can be done by a second
call to <code>sgesvd</code>.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>call sgesvd('A', 'A', nr_rows, nr_cols, M, nr_rows, S, &amp;
            U, nr_rows, VT, nr_cols, work, work_size, info)</code></pre>
