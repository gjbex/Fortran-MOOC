<h1 id="documentation-best-practices">Documentation best practices</h1>
<p>When you consider using a new software library, you probably like to
start by looking at some example code. You’ll do a few experiments of
your own, based on those examples. Once you start using the new library
for non-trivial applications, you will most likely have to refer to the
reference guide. All this documentation is a great help if its quality
is good.</p>
<p>If you want to deliver high quality software, the documentation is a
very important aspect of the development process. You can distinguish
between two types of documentation: tutorial style and reference
documentation.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-documentation">Types of documentation</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, we distinguish two types of documentation,
tutorials and reference guides. They serve different purposes, and hence
are complementary.</p>
<p><em>Tutorials</em> will typically illustrate a number of use cases,
presented as a narrative. It is more of a high-level overview of the
software project. Such documentation is typically written separately
from the source code, and a convenient format is markdown. We will
discuss MkDocs, a tools to generate nice looking documentation based on
this format.</p>
<p>A <em>reference guide</em> serves a different purpose. It is intended
to get low-level information on the contents of the library. It should
be easy to navigate, so that one can view the definition of a datatype
by clicking it when it occurs in the signature of a function. Hence this
type of documentation integrates closely with the source code itself. If
the latter changes, so should the former.</p>
<h2 id="pitfalls">Pitfalls</h2>
<p>When working on a software project, one of the main pitfalls is
neglecting documentation. Many developers don’t particularly enjoy
writing documentation, and hence postpone it. The more classes and
functions to be documented, the worse the tasks seems to be, and the
larger the probability that it will never happen.</p>
<p>Getting into the habit of immediately writing the reference
documentation for each module, user defined type or procedure as you
code is certainly a “best practice”. Although it may seem to slow you
down while coding, that is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>However, even when documentation is diligently written while coding,
it has to be kept up to date when code changes. It is all too easy to
forget to update the documentation when the signature of a function is
modified. Inaccurate documentation is almost worse than no documentation
since it is likely to cause serious software defects.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-document">What to document?</h2>
<p>The first question to answer is, what do you need to document since a
software project has many artifacts.</p>
<h3 id="documenting-procedures">Documenting procedures</h3>
<p>Consider the documentation of a function or a subroutine for
instance. You would write a description of what the it does, which
argument it takes, and what the return type is. However, you would also
add the assumptions the procedure makes about the values its arguments
can have.</p>
<p>Such assumptions are called preconditions. By way of example,
consider a function that takes a temperature as an argument. An
important aspect is the units it expects the temperature to be specified
in. Will that be degrees Celsius, or Fahrenheit, or Kelvin? In case it
is degrees Celsius, it doesn’t make sense to pass a value to the
function that is less than -273.15 degrees Celsius. On the other hand,
if it is Kelvin, the value should be positive. Needless to say that if
you pass a temperature expressed in Kelvin to a function that expects
degrees Celsius as a unit, the results will be wrong.</p>
<p>This example illustrates an important point: the procedure
documentation should clearly specify its expectation about the arguments
that you pass to it. In our example, that would be the units of the
temperature, but also the valid range of values. These restrictions are
often called preconditions, and they constitute a contract between the
user of the procedure and its author.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The contract, i.e., the precondition, says that if the user of the
function supplies arguments that fulfill all the preconditions, then the
author guarantees that the function will return proper results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When considering values returned by a procedure, you have to consider
similar restrictions. What are the units of the return value and what is
the range of values that would make sense? This amounts to
postconditions, again a contract between the procedure’s author and its
user.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The contract, i.e., the postcondition, specifies that the user of the
procedure can rely on it to return a value that fulfills all the
conditions if she calls it correctly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a procedure has side effects, i.e., it modifies one of its
arguments, this should be stated as well. The “principle of least
astonishment” is very useful in software development.</p>
<p>Conversely, when passing an argument to a function that is not
changed at all, that constitutes an invariant. Although it may be useful
to state this in the documentation, it is far better practice to make
that explicit by using <code>intent(in)</code>.</p>
<p>The concepts of preconditions, postconditions, and invariants were
introduced in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">“design by
contract”</a> paradigm, pioneered by Bertrand Meyer in 1986.</p>
<p>If you make it part of your coding process to immediately provide the
documentation when writing a procedure, it will actually help you since
you have to make your assumptions explicit, and hence may discover
potential flaws.</p>
<p>Documenting failure is very important as well. Can the procedure
generate an error? What is the semantics of these errors? Again, this is
an application of the “principle of least astonishment”. The user of
your procedures will be aware of potential failure, and can code to deal
with it appropriately.</p>
<h3 id="documenting-user-defined-types">Documenting user defined
types</h3>
<p>For user defined types, the semantics of the type should be
documented. What does a variable of the type represent? Of course, the
type name should be chosen so that this is clear, but it doesn’t hurt to
explain this more formally in the documentation as well.</p>
<p>For each member, you should document its type, semantics, and, if
applicable, the units that are expected.</p>
<p>When doing object oriented programming, the documentation of type
bound procedures is similar to that of functions.</p>
<h3 id="documenting-modules">Documenting modules</h3>
<p>Code is typically aggregated according to functionality in Fortran
modules for separate compilation. Hence this aggregation has a purpose,
and you should document that as well. What is the overall purpose of the
module? Another question that you can answer in module documentation is
the interaction between various components. How can the output of one
procedure be used as the input for another, are the various procedures
independent, or should they be called in a certain order?</p>
<p>As an example, if you have a procedure that initializes a data
structure, a few that manipulate such data structures, and a
finalization procedure that releases the resources in that data
structure, then the module documentation should probably mention that
you should</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>call the initialization procedure to get a valid data
structure;</li>
<li>call procedures that use the data structure; and</li>
<li>call the finalization procedure to avoid memory leaks.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this level, you may want to add some example code of using the
software components in that module. How do you call the procedures, how
can you use the return values, what are the use cases? This type of
documentation could also be maintained at the project level, though.</p>
<h3 id="documenting-projects">Documenting projects</h3>
<p>This is typically high-level documentation in the form of a tutorial
with use cases and code samples. It should of course contain a link to
the reference documentation.</p>
<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
<p>In this session, we will discuss two tools for creating attractive
documentation, Doxygen and MkDocs. The former is best suited for
reference guides, while the latter is excellent for tutorial-style
material.</p>
<h3 id="doxygen">Doxygen</h3>
<p>Some programming languages such as Java and Python provide support
for documentation as part of their specification. The languages we use
most frequently in an HPC context, C, C++, and Fortran, have no such
provisions. However, <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a>
generates reference documentation out of comment blocks for a wide
variety of programming languages, including those of interest to us.
This documentation is fully hyperlinked. For instance, clicking the type
of a function’s argument will bring you to the type’s documentation.</p>
<h3 id="mkdocs">MkDocs</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.mkdocs.org/">MkDocs</a> is a very convenient tool
for generating nice looking documentation that can be viewed standalone
as HTML pages, or that can be served from the <a href="http://www.readthedocs.org/">Read the Docs service</a>. It
automatically generates a navigation panel and adds search
functionality. You can also define a GitHub trigger that will
automatically push your project’s documentation to Read the Docs each
time you do a release. Documentation of previous software versions
remain available. In that scenario, MkDocs will provide useful previews
before you make a release of your code project.</p>
