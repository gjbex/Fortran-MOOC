<h1 id="bit-wise-operations">Bit-wise operations</h1>
<p>Although bit-wise operations do not figure prominently in scientific
computing there are definitely applications. Fortran has a number of
intrinsic procedures that allow to do this. It is important to note that
these procedures can only be applied to integer data types.</p>
<p>The bit-wise operations you expect are available: <code>not</code>,
<code>iand</code>, <code>ior</code>, <code>ieor</code> (exclusive-or).
All these functions are elemental, so they can be applied to arrays.</p>
<p>The number of bits of a value can be determined using the
<code>bit_size</code> function.</p>
<p>The function <code>shiftl</code> lets you shift the bits in an
integer by a given number of bits to the left. correspondingly,
<code>shiftr</code> shifts the bits to the right. The
<code>cshift</code> function performs a circular shift. Note that the
shift should not exceed the number of bits of the value.</p>
<p>Other useful functions allow to set (<code>ibset</code>) and clear
(<code>ibclr</code>) bits at specific positions. Note that the positions
are 0-based, so the least significant bit is at position 0.</p>
<p>The <code>ibits</code> function can be used to select bits from a
given position (0-based) and with a given length.</p>
<p>For instance, below you find a (naive) function that computes the
number of bits set in an integer.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">function naive_count_bits(n) result(bit_count)
    implicit none
    integer(kind=I4), value :: n
    integer :: bit_count
    integer :: i
    
    bit_count = 0
    do i = 1, 32
        bit_count = bit_count + and(n, 1_I4)
        n = shiftr(n, 1)
    end do
end function naive_count_bits</code></pre>
