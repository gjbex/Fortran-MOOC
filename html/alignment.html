<h1 id="data-alignment">Data alignment</h1>
<p>For best performance, data items should be aligned on certain address
boundaries in memory.</p>
<ul>
<li>8-bit data (e.g., <code>character</code> or integer kind
<code>INT8</code>) can be placed anywhere;</li>
<li>16-bit data (e.g., integer kind <code>INT16</code>) should be placed
on addresses that are multiples of 2 bytes;</li>
<li>32-bit data (e.g., integer kind <code>INT32</code> or real kine
<code>REAL32</code>) should be placed on addresses that are multiples of
4 bytes;</li>
<li>64-bit data (e.g., integer kind <code>INT64</code> or real kind
<code>REAL64</code>) should be placed on addresses that are multiples of
8 bytes;</li>
<li>128-bit data (e.g., real kind <code>REAL128</code>) should be placed
on addresses that are multiples of 16-byte.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should understand the phrase “multiple of n bytes” as placed on a
multiple of n bytes with respect to the base address.</p>
<p>This alignment is called natural, and in general, the compiler will
ensure that this is indeed the memory layout, adding padding as required
for natural alignment.</p>
<p>However, there are a few situations in which the compiler will not
enforce natural alignment. This is the case for old-style constructs
such as <code>structure</code> and <code>record</code>, as well as
common blocks. If you (have to) use these constructs, you would have to
ensure that data is naturally aligned by appropriately specifying the
order of the data items or variables. Some compilers have flags to align
common blocks automatically.</p>
<p>A situation that is still relevant in modern Fortran is the use of
<code>sequence</code> in a user defined type. Since this is often
required in the context of using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) it
is useful to understand alignment.</p>
<h2 id="aligned-versus-non-aligned-data">Aligned versus non-aligned
data</h2>
<p>Consider the following user defined type definition:</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">type :: particle_t
    sequence
    integer :: charge
    real(kind=REAL64) :: x, y
end type</code></pre>
<p>Due to the <code>sequence</code> statement, the compiler will not
naturally align the data. In this case, <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> will not be aligned, which has a performance impact. This
is illustrated in the figure below.</p>

<p>Changing the order of the elements of the <code>particle_t</code>
user defined type solves this issue.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">type :: particle_t
    sequence
    real(kind=REAL64) :: x, y
    integer :: charge
end type</code></pre>
<p>Now none of the elements cross alignment boundaries as illustrated in
the figure below.</p>
