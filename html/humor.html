<p>There are jokes about most programming languages, and Fortran is no
exception. some of them are a little dated and mention programming
languages you’ve never heard of.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In Fortran, god is real, unless declared otherwise.</p></li>

<li><p>A computer without COBOL and Fortran is like a piece of chocolate
cake without ketchup and mustard.</p></li>
<li><p>Q: What does a Fortran77 programmer call a pointer? A: A dummy
argument.</p></li>

<li><p>Programming Languages are Like Cars</p>
<ul>
<li>Assembler: A formula I race car. Very fast but difficult to drive
and maintain.</li>
<li>FORTRAN II: A Model T Ford. Once it was the king of the road.</li>
<li>FORTRAN IV: A Model A Ford.</li>
<li>FORTRAN 77: a six-cylinder Ford Fairlane with standard transmission
and no seat belts.</li>
<li>COBOL: A delivery van. It’s bulky and ugly but it does the
work.</li>
<li>BASIC: A second-hand Rambler with a rebuilt engine and patched
upholstery. Your dad bought it for you to learn to drive. You’ll ditch
it as soon as you can afford a new one.</li>
<li>PL/I: A Cadillac convertible with automatic transmission, a two-tone
paint job, white-wall tires, chrome exhaust pipes, and fuzzy dice
hanging in the windshield.</li>
<li>C++: A black Firebird, the all macho car. Comes with optional
seatbelt (lint) and optional fuzz buster (escape to assembler).</li>
<li>ALGOL 60: An Austin Mini. Boy that’s a small car.</li>
<li>ALGOL 68: An Aston Martin. An impressive car but not just anyone can
drive it.</li>
<li>Pascal: A Volkswagon Beetle. It’s small but sturdy. Was once popular
with intellectual types.</li>
<li>LISP: An electric car. It’s simple but slow. Seat belts are not
available.</li>
<li>PROLOG/LUCID: Prototype concept cars.</li>
<li>FORTH: A go-cart.</li>
<li>LOGO: A kiddie’s replica of a Rolls Royce. Comes with a real engine
and a working horn.</li>
<li>APL: A double-decker bus. It takes rows and columns of passengers to
the same place all at the same time but it drives only in reverse and is
instrumented in Greek.</li>
<li>Ada: An army-green Mercedes-Benz staff car. Power steering, power
brakes, and automatic transmission are standard. No other colors or
options are available. If it’s good enough for generals, it’s good
enough for you.</li>
<li>Java: All-terrain very slow vehicle.</li>

<li><p>(in 1980) Q: What will the scientific programming language of the
year 2000 look like? A: Nobody knows, but its name will be
FORTRAN.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistently separating words by spaces became a general custom
about the tenth century A. D., and lasted until about 1957, when FORTRAN
abandoned the practice. (Sun FORTRAN Reference Manual)</p></li>
<li><p>“FORTRAN, the infantile disorder, by now nearly 20 years old, is
hopelessly inadequate for whatever computer application you have in mind
today: it is now too clumsy, too risky, and too expensive to
use.”(Edsger W. Dijkstra, circa 1970, known for very strong
opinions)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://9gag.com/gag/arG5o15">1-based array
indexing</a></p></li>
<li><p>When X3J3 debated whether the minimum trip count for a DO loop
should be zero or one in Fortran 77, Loren Meissner suggested a minimum
trip count of two—reasoning (tongue-in-cheek) that if it was less than
two then there would be no reason for a loop!</p></li>
<li><p>During the same FORTRAN standards committee meeting at which the
name “FORTRAN 77” was chosen, a satirical technical proposal was
incorporated into the official distribution bearing the title “Letter O
Considered Harmful”. This proposal purported to address the confusion
that sometimes arises between the letter “O” and the numeral zero, by
eliminating the letter from allowable variable names. However, the
method proposed was to eliminate the letter from the character set
entirely (thereby retaining 48 as the number of lexical characters,
which the colon had increased to 49). This was considered beneficial in
that it would promote structured programming, by making it impossible to
use the notorious GO TO statement as before. (Troublesome FORMAT
statements would also be eliminated.) It was noted that this “might
invalidate some existing programs” but that most of these “probably were
non-conforming, anyway”.</p></li>
<li><p>When assumed-length arrays were being added, there was a dispute
as to the appropriate character to separate upper and lower bounds. In a
comment examining these arguments, Dr. Walt Brainerd penned an article
entitled “Astronomy vs. Gastroenterology” because some proponents had
suggested using the star or asterisk (“<code>*</code>”), while others
favored the colon (“<code>:</code>”).</p></li>
