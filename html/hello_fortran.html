<h1 id="hello-fortran">Hello Fortran</h1>
<p>In this article you’ll get a brief overview of what a simple Fortran
program looks like.</p>
<p>Fortran programs consist of compilation units, and must have one and
only one <code>program</code> unit. The code you see below is the “hello
world” application in Fortran.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">program hello_fortran
    print *, 'hello Fortran!'
end program hello_fortran</code></pre>
<p>The <code>program</code> unit’s statements are bracketed by
<code>program &lt;name&gt;</code> and
<code>end program &lt;name&gt;</code>. In this case, the unit has just a
single statement, the <code>print</code> statement that will write the
string <code>'hello Fortran!'</code> to standard output. The
<code>*</code> denotes the default format, but you will learn more about
that later.</p>
<p>On the command line, you can compile the source code in
’hello_world.f90` into an executable application using a compiler. Here,
we will use the GCC Fortran compiler.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code class="language-fortran">$ gfortran hello_fortran.f90</code></pre>
<p>The resulting executable is <code>a.out</code> and when you run it,
it will print the expected output.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code class="language-fortran">$ ./a.out
 hello Fortran!</code></pre>
<p>Congratulations, you have just build and run your very first Fortran
program!</p>
