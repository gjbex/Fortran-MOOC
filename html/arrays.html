<h1 id="arrays">Arrays</h1>
<p>In scientific programming arrays play a very important role. You will
use them to represent vectors (1-dimensional arrays), matrices
(2-dimensional arrays), and so on.</p>
<p>An array is a collection of values that can be selected using an
index. For example, consider the following array declaration in
Fortran.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer, dimension(5) :: A</code></pre>
<p>Here, the name of the array is <code>A</code>, it has 5 elements, as
specified by <code>dimension</code>, and each of its elements is an
integer, type <code>integer</code>. The first element of the array is
<code>A(1)</code>, the second <code>A(2)</code>, the last
<code>A(5)</code>. So in more abstract terms, you can view an array as
an ordered sequence of objects, all with the same type.</p>
<p>By default, array indices start from 1 and go up to the size of the
array. This is similar to other programming languages such as MATLAB, R
and Julia, but different from languages such as C, C++ and Python.</p>
<p>Short aside: note the common factor in Fortran, MATLAB, R and Julia,
all these programming languages were specifically designed for
scientific computing and doing mathematics. C, C++ and Python are
positioned as general purpose languages, not specific to any domain.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-array-elements">Accessing array elements</h2>
<p>The following Fortran program shows how to work with individual array
elements.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">program array_elements
    implicit none
    integer, dimension(5) :: A
    integer :: i

    A(1) = 1
    do i = 2, size(A)
        A(i)  = 2*A(i - 1)
    end do
    print *, A
end program array_elements</code></pre>
<p>The <code>size</code> intrinsic function returns the number of
elements of an array. Here it is used as the final index of the array
<code>A</code>.</p>
<h2 id="array-initialization">Array initialization</h2>
<p>In the last example of the previous section, the array was
initialized element-wise. Although this is fairly common, you can use a
few more convenient approaches.</p>
<p>The following program illustrates three options.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">program array_initialization
    implicit none
    integer :: i
    integer, dimension(5) :: A, B, C

    A = 13
    B = [ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 ] 
    C = [ (2**i, i=0,4) ] 
    print *, A
    print *, B
    print *, C
end program array_initialization</code></pre>
<p>This program generates the following output.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fortran">         13          13          13          13          13
          2           3           5           7          11
          1           2           4           8          16</code></pre>
<p>For the array <code>A</code>, the value 13 is assigned to each
element. For array <code>B</code>, the values for the respective
elements are listed explicitly. The initialization method is obviously
only useful for short arrays. The array <code>C</code> is initialized
using an implicit do loop over the variable <code>i</code>.</p>
<h2 id="array-arithmetic">Array arithmetic</h2>
<p>Arrays are first-class citizens in Fortran, so you can perform
arithmetic directly on arrays. The following program illustrates
this.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">program array_arithmetic
    implicit none
    real, dimension(5) :: A = [ 1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.6 ], &amp;
                          B = [ -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0], &amp;
                          C

    C = A + 2.0*B
    print *, C
end program array_arithmetic</code></pre>
<p>The unary operator <code>-</code> can be applied to an array, and
will change the sign of all the elements of the array, i.e.,
<code>A_new(i) = -A(i)</code>. Here <code>A_new</code> represents the
resulting array.</p>
<p>The binary operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>,
<code>/</code> and <code>**</code> can be used with a scalar operand and
the semantics <code>A_new(i) = scalar &lt;op&gt; A(i)</code> or
<code>A_new(i) = A(i) &lt;op&gt; scalar</code>. Here,
<code>&lt;op&gt;</code> represents the binary operator and scalar is a
value that can be converted to the type of the array’s elements.</p>
<p>The binary operators can also have an array as both their left and
right operands. The semantics is
<code>C_new(i) = A(i) &lt;op&gt; B(i)</code>, where <code>A</code> and
<code>B</code> are the original arrays, and <code>C_new</code>
represents the new one.</p>
<h2 id="subarrays">Subarrays</h2>
<p>Fortran lets you select a subarray out of an array. This is quite
similar to list or string slicing in Python. The following program
illustrates subarrays.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">program subarrays
    implicit none
    integer :: i
    integer, dimension(10) :: A = [ (i, i = 1, 10) ]
    character(len=10), parameter :: FMT = '(10I3)'

    print FMT, A
    print FMT, A(4:7)
    print FMT, A(:7)
    print FMT, A(4:)
    print FMT, A(4:7:2)
    print FMT, A(4::2)
    print FMT, A(:7:2)
    print FMT, A(7:4:-1)
end program subarrays</code></pre>
<p>The output of this program is given below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fortran"> 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
 4  5  6  7
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7
 4  5  6  7  8  9 10
 4  6
 4  6  8 10
 1  3  5  7
 7  6  5  4</code></pre>
<p>The most general form of subarray section is
<code>&lt;start&gt;:&lt;end&gt;:&lt;delta&gt;</code>, where
<code>&lt;start&gt;</code> is the first index, <code>&lt;end&gt;</code>
is the last index (inclusive), and <code>&lt;delta&gt;</code> is the
increment.</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>&lt;delta&gt;</code> is positive, the array indices are
computed as <code>&lt;start&gt; + i*&lt;delta&gt;</code> for values of
<code>i</code> starting from 0 and up to a value <code>i_max</code> such
that <code>&lt;start&gt; + i_max*&lt;delta&gt;</code> is less than or
equal to <code>&lt;end&gt;</code>. Note that <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>
is less than or equal to <code>&lt;end&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>&lt;delta&gt;</code> is negative, the array indices are
similarly, but the last value will be
<code>&lt;start&gt; + i_max*&lt;delta&gt;</code> such that it is larger
than or equal to <code>&lt;end&gt;</code>. Note that in that case
<code>&lt;start&gt;</code> should be larger than or equal to
<code>&lt;end&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>&lt;delta&gt;</code> is omitted, it defaults to 1.</p>
<p>As you can see <code>&lt;start&gt;</code> and/or
<code>&lt;end&gt;</code> can be left out. If <code>&lt;start&gt;</code>
is left out, it defaults to the first index, if <code>&lt;end&gt;</code>
is left out, it defaults to the last index.</p>
<p>Note: using strided subarrays, i.e., <code>&lt;delta&gt;</code> not
equal to 1, can result in performance issues.</p>
<h2 id="multidimensional-arrays">Multidimensional arrays</h2>
<p>Up to this point, you have only see examples of one dimensional
arrays, or arrays with rank 1. Fortran supports multidimensional arrays
with ranks up to 15 (as of Fortran 2008).</p>
<p>In the program below, a two dimensional array is initialized,
printed, and the sum of the squares of the elements is computed using
explicit do loops.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">program matrix
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: ROWS = 3, COLS = 5
    real, dimension(ROWS, COLS) :: A
    integer :: i, j
    real :: total

    A = reshape([ (((i - 1)*size(A, 2) + j, j=1,size(A, 2)), i=1,size(A, 1)) ], &amp;
                shape(A))
    do i = 1, size(A, 1)
        print *, A(i, :)
    end do
    total = 0.0
    do j = 1, size(A, 2)
        do i = 1, size(A, 1)
            total = total + A(i, j)**2
        end do
    end do
    print '(/, A, F10.2)', 'total = ', total
end program matrix</code></pre>
<p>The output of the program is shown below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fortran">   1.00000000       4.00000000       7.00000000       10.0000000       13.0000000    
   2.00000000       5.00000000       8.00000000       11.0000000       14.0000000    
   3.00000000       6.00000000       9.00000000       12.0000000       15.0000000    

total =    1240.00</code></pre>
<p>The first index of array <code>A</code> refers to the row, the second
to the column, e.g., <code>A(2, 3)</code> would be the element on the
second row, third column.</p>
<p>Note that in the nested do loops, the outer loop ranges over the
column index, while the inner loop ranges over the row index. The reason
is that two dimensional arrays in Fortran are stored column-wise. In
general, the inner loop should range over the rank of which the index
changes the fastest, so that is the row index for rank 2 arrays.</p>
<p>The shape of an array is the size in each dimension, so for the
matrix <code>A</code>, the shape would be <code>3, 5</code>.</p>
<p>Just as for one dimensional arrays, you can select subarrays from
multidimensional arrays as well. Suppose that <code>A</code> is a \(5 \times 5\) matrix, then the the
expression <code>A(2:3, 2:4)</code> will create a \(2 \times 3\) subarray with the values
<code>A(2, 2)</code>, <code>A(2, 3)</code>, <code>A(2, 4)</code> in its
first row, and <code>A(3, 2)</code>, <code>A(3, 3)</code> and
<code>A(3, 4)</code> in its second row.</p>
<p>You can select an entire row or column from a two dimensional array
as well. For example, <code>A(2, :)</code> is a subarray that consists
of the elements of <code>A</code>’s second row. Similarly,
<code>A(:, 3)</code> has the elements of the third column of
<code>A</code>. Note that both <code>A(2, :)</code> and
<code>A(:, 3)</code> have rank 1 and size 5.</p>
<h2 id="intrinsic-procedures">Intrinsic procedures</h2>
<p>Fortran has many intrinsic procedures for arrays. You already saw a
few of them in action.</p>
<h3 id="size-and-shape">Size and shape</h3>
<p>The <code>size</code> intrinsic function returns the number of
elements of an array. It has the dimension as an optional argument for
use with multidimensional arrays, e.g., <code>size(A, 1)</code> will
return the number of rows of the array, <code>size(A, 2)</code> the
number of columns.</p>
<p>The <code>shape</code> intrinsic function returns a one dimensional
array with the dimensions for the array. So for a \(3 \times 5\) array, the <code>shape</code>
function returns the array <code>[3, 5]</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>rank</code> intrinsic function returns the rank of an
array, i.e., its number of dimensions.</p>
<p>The <code>reshape</code> intrinsic function takes two arguments. The
first argument is an array of any shape, the second is a one dimensional
array that specifies a new shape. In the example code in the previous
section, a one dimensional array of size 15 (constructed using implicit
do loops) is reshaped into a two dimensional \(3 \times 5\) array. Note that the size of
the array should be equal to the product of the new dimensions. For
example, you can reshape a \(4 \times
5\) array into a \(2 \times
10\) array, or into a one dimensional array with 20 elements. It
can even be reshaped into a three dimensional \(2 \times 2 \times 5\) array.</p>
<h3 id="mathematical-functions">Mathematical functions</h3>
<p>Most mathematical function such as the trigonometric functions and
their inverse, the exponential and logarithmic functions and the square
root can be applied to an array of any rank to produce a new array of
the same rank with elements that are the result of applying the function
to the corresponding element in the original array. So
<code>A_new(i) = &lt;func&gt;(A(i))</code>. Such procedures are called
elemental and you’ll see in one of the next section how to create your
own.</p>
<p>The scalar product of two vectors (i.e, one dimensional arrays) can
be computed using the intrinsic function <code>dot_product</code>. The
vector-matrix, matrix-vector or matrix-matrix product can be computed
using the intrinsic function <code>matmul</code>. As you would expect,
the dimensions must match, so for <code>matmul(A, B)</code>,
<code>size(A, 2)</code> must be equal to <code>size(B, 1)</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> intrinsic functions
compute the sum and product of the elements of an array
respectively.</p>
<h3 id="finding-and-counting">Finding and counting</h3>
<p>The intrinsic functions <code>maxval</code> will return the maximum
value of an array. The corresponding intrinsic function
<code>maxloc</code> returns the index or indices of the element with the
highest value in the array. When applied to a multidimensional array,
this function will return a one dimensional array with the same size as
the rank of the argument. If there are multiple elements with the same
maximum value, the index or indices of the first such element is
returned.</p>
<p>Obviously, the intrinsic functions <code>minval</code> and
<code>minloc</code> are similar to <code>maxval</code> and
<code>maxloc</code>.</p>
<h3 id="masks-and-dimension">Masks and dimension</h3>
<p>Intrinsic functions similar to <code>sum</code> and
<code>maxval</code> accept two optional arguments <code>dim</code> and
<code>mask</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>dim</code> is specified, the result returned by the function
is an array with a rank one less than that of the argument. So for a two
dimensional array <code>A</code>, <code>maxval(A, dim=1)</code> would
return a one dimensional array. The elements of that array would be the
maximum value over each column in <code>A</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>mask</code> argument is a <code>logical</code> array of the
same shape as the argument array. If an element of the
<code>logical</code> array is <code>.TRUE.</code>, the value of the
corresponding element in the argument array is taken into account, if it
is <code>.FALSE.</code> it is not taken into account.</p>
<p>The following program illustrates the optional arguments
<code>dim</code> and <code>mask</code> when used with the intrinsic
functions <code>maxval</code> and <code>macloc</code>.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">program max_array
    implicit none
    integer, dimension(3, 4) :: A
    integer :: i, j
    character(len=10), parameter :: FMT = '(A, 4I13)'

    A = reshape( [ (((i - 1)*size(A, 2) + j, j=1,size(A, 2)), i=1,size(A, 1)) ], &amp;
                shape(A)) - 8
    do i = 1, size(A, 1)
        print *, A(i, :)
    end do
    print FMT, 'maximum = ', maxval(A)
    print FMT, 'column maximum = ', maxval(A, dim=1)
    print FMT, 'row maximum = ', maxval(A, dim=2)
    print FMT, 'maximum odd elment = ', maxval(A, mask=mod(A, 2) /= 0)
    print FMT, 'column maximum negative elment = ', maxval(A, dim=1, mask=A &lt; 0)
    print FMT, 'maxloc = ', maxloc(A)
    print FMT, 'column maxloc = ', maxloc(A, dim=1)
end program max_array</code></pre>
<p>The output of this program is shown below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fortran">         -7          -4          -1           2
         -6          -3           0           3

column maxloc =             3            3            3            3</code></pre>
<p>Note the output for <code>maxval(A, dim=1, mask=A &lt; 0)</code>. The
last value is not exactly what you would expect. However, when you
inspect the matrix, you will see that the last column has no negative
elements. This is an example of garbage in (this code), garbage out.</p>
<p>The <code>count</code> function uses a mask to count elements in an
array that satisfy some Boolean condition, e.g.,
<code>count(A &gt;= 0)</code> will return the number of positive
elements in the array <code>A</code>. It takes an optional argument
<code>dim</code> as well.</p>
<h2 id="extent">Extent</h2>
<p>Although the default indices of a Fortran array range from 1 to the
size of the array, it is possible to declare arrays with a non-default
extent. Consider the following array declaration.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">real, dimension(-10:10) :: A</code></pre>
<p>This declares an array named <code>A</code> that has 21 elements of
type <code>real</code>. The first element is at index -10, the second at
-9, and so on. The last element has index 10.</p>
<p>The intrinsic functions <code>lbound</code> and <code>ubound</code>
return the lower and upper bound(s) of an array respectively. Similar to
the <code>size</code> function, these intrinsic functions take an
optional argument <code>dim</code> to specify the dimension for which
you want the upper or lower bound.</p>
<p>If you feel tempted at this point to emulate 0-based indices because
that is what you are used to in some other programming language, please
don’t. It adds complexity to your code and makes it harder to read for
seasoned Fortran programmers (also, they will make fun of you).</p>
<p>Regardless, arrays with non-default upper and lower bounds indices
definitely have their use cases.</p>
<h2 id="arrays-and-user-defined-procedures">Arrays and user-defined
procedures</h2>
<p>Arrays can be passed as arguments to user-defined procedures, and be
returned as the result of functions. You can even create your own
elemental procedures that act on individual array elements just like
intrinsic procedures such as, e.g., <code>sqrt</code>.</p>
<h3 id="assumed-shape-arguments">Assumed-shape arguments</h3>
<p>You may think that there is a problem when you have to declare an
argument of a procedure that is an array: how to specify its shape? If
the shape would have to be specified explicitly, e.g,
<code>dimension(3, 4)</code> writing and using procedures involving
arrays would be <em>very</em> cumbersome. Fortunately, Fortran offers a
very elegant solution: assumed-shape arrays.</p>
<p>The code fragment below shows a function that has a two dimensional
array that is supposed to represent a square matrix as an argument, and
computes the trace.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">    real function trace(matrix)
        use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : error_unit
        implicit none
        real, dimension(:, :), intent(in) :: matrix
        integer :: i

        if (size(matrix, 1) /= size(matrix, 2)) then
            write (unit=error_unit, fmt='(A)') &amp;
                'error: can not compute trace of a non-square matrix'
            stop 1
        end if
        trace = 0.0
        do i = 1, size(matrix, 1)
            trace = trace + matrix(i, i)
        end do
    end function trace</code></pre>
<p>The function’s argument is an array of rank 2, but unspecified size
(<code>dimension(:, :)</code>), however, the information about the shape
of the array is available when the function is executed. The
<code>size</code> and <code>shape</code> intrinsic functions will return
the values corresponding to the array in the calling context.</p>
<h3 id="elemental-procedures">Elemental procedures</h3>
<p>Elemental procedures are pure procedures that operate on a single
scalar value. When it receives an array as an argument, it is applied
element-wise The following Fortran program shows an elemental function
and its application.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">program linear_transform
    implicit none
    real, dimension(5) :: values

    call random_number(values)
    print *, values
    print *, lin_transform(values, 2.0, 1.0)

contains

    elemental real function lin_transform(x, a, b)
        implicit none
        real, intent(in) :: x, a, b

        lin_transform = a*x + b
    end function lin_transform

end program linear_transform</code></pre>
<p>Many of Fortran’s intrinsic functions are elemental, e.g.,
<code>sqrt</code> or the trigonometric functions. It is quite useful
that you can define your own functions that can be applied to an entire
array at once.</p>
<p>Note that also subroutines can be elemental.</p>
<h3 id="arrays-as-return-values">Arrays as return values</h3>
<p>Fortran procedures can also return arrays as a result of a function
call. The following function illustrates that. Given a size, it
constructs an identity matrix (represented as two dimensional
array).</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">    function eye(n) result(matrix)
        implicit none
        integer, value :: n
        real, dimension(n, n) :: matrix
        integer :: i

        matrix = 0.0
        do i = 1, size(matrix, 1)
            matrix(i, i) = 1.0
        end do
    end function eye</code></pre>
<h2 id="array-related-statements">Array-related statements</h2>
<p>The fact that arrays are first-class citizens in Fortran is further
illustrated by two statements. The first is the where statement, the
second the forall statement.</p>
<h3 id="where-statement">where statement</h3>
<p>The where statement makes conditional assignment to array elements
considerably simpler.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the random initialization of a system of
particles. Approximately half of the particles are protons, the other
half electrons. The masses and charges for the particles are stored in
an array <code>masses</code> and <code>charges</code> respectively. The
number of particles is stored in the parameter
<code>nr_particles</code>.</p>
<p>This could be implemented as follows.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
real, dimension(nr_particles) :: masses, charges
real :: probability
integer :: i

do i = 1, nr_particles
    call random_number(probability)
    if (probability &lt; 0.5) then
        masses(i) = proton_mass
        charges(i) = proton_charge
    else
        masses(i) = electron_mass
        charges(i) = electron_charge
    end if
end do
...</code></pre>
<p>The <code>random_number</code> procedure will assign a pseudo-random
number in the half-open interval 0.0 to 1.0.</p>
<p>Although this may seem the obvious way to implement this, there is an
arguably more elegant alternative using the where statement.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
real, dimension(nr_particles) :: masses, charges, probabilities

call random_number(probabilities)
where (probabilities &lt; 0.5)
    masses = proton_mass
    charges = proton_charge
elsewhere
    masses = electron_mass
    charges = electron_charge
end where
...</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps the easiest explanation of this statement is its translation
into a do and if statement which is functionally equivalent.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
real, dimension(nr_particles) :: masses, charges, probabilities

call random_number(probabilities)
do i = 1, nr_particles
    if (probabilities(i) &lt; 0.5) then
        masses(i) = proton_mass
        charges(i) = proton_charge
    else
        masses(i) = electron_mass
        charges(i) = electron_charge
    end if

<p>Using the where statement has a number of advantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>it reduces the number of statements, simplifying the code;</li>
<li>it expresses your intent more clearly, so the compiler can take
advantage for optimization.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since all assignments are independent, the compiler is free to
generate code that does them in any order.</p>
<p>The general form of the where statement syntax is.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fortran">where (&lt;logical expression 1&gt;)
    &lt;block statements 1&gt;
elsewhere (&lt;logical expression 2&gt;)
    &lt;block statements 2&gt;
...
elsewhere
    &lt;block statements n&gt;
end where</code></pre>
<p>If you have a simple case with a single, unconditional
<code>elsewhere</code>, the <code>merge</code> function can be a nice
alternative.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
real, dimension(nr_particles) :: masses, charges, probabilities

call random_number(probabilities)
masses = merge(proton_mass, electron_mass, probabilities &lt; 0.5)
charges = merge(proton_charge, electron_charge, probabilities &lt; 0.5)
...</code></pre>
<h3 id="forall-statement">forall statement</h3>
<p>Another statement that is very useful in the context of arrays is
forall. This statement lets you iterate over one or more integer
variables and set conditions on the values of these indices. For
instance, suppose you would like to initialize a triangular matrix with
all elements under the main diagonal equal to 0.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer, parameter :: N
integer :: i, j
real, dimension(N, N) :: A

forall (i=1:N, j=1:N, i &lt;= j)
    A(i, j) = f(i, j)
end forall</code></pre>
<p>This would be equivalent to the following code.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer, parameter :: N
integer :: i, j
real, dimension(N, N) :: A

do i = 1, N
    do j = i, N
        A(i, j) = f(i, j)
    end do
end do</code></pre>
<p>Note that the iterations are independent of one another, so when the
forall statement is used, the compiler is free to choose an efficient
order for the iterations. This construct also collapses the iteration
space from multiple iterations into a single one.</p>
<p>The general syntax for the forall statement is given below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fortran">forall (&lt;iter 1&gt;, ..., &lt;iter n&gt;, &lt;logical expression&gt;)
    &lt;array assignments&gt;
end forall</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;iter 1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;iter n&gt;</code> have
the form <code>&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;first&gt;:&lt;last&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;first&gt;:&lt;last&gt;:&lt;stride&gt;</code>.
The values of <code>&lt;first&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;last&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;stride&gt;</code> should not refer to other iteration
variables. This means our example can not be written as follows since
<code>j</code> is initialized using the value of <code>i</code>.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">forall (i=1:N, j=i:N)
    A(i, j) = f(i, j)
end forall</code></pre>
<p>If the conditional expression, also called the mask, is left out, it
is assumed to be true for all iteration values.</p>
<p>Note that only assignments to arrays are allowed in the block of a
forall statement.</p>
<h2 id="do-concurrent">do concurrent</h2>
<p>Whereas the forall statement can be used for array assignment only,
the do concurrent statement is more general. The syntax is very similar
to that of forall.</p>
<p>For instance, the example in the previous section can be written
using do concurrent.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">do concurrent (i=1:N, j=i:N)
    A(i, j) = f(i, j)
end do</code></pre>
<p>The general syntax for the do concurrent statement is given
below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fortran">do concurrent (&lt;iter 1&gt;, ..., &lt;iter n&gt;, &lt;logical expression&gt;)
    &lt;block statements&gt;
end do</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;iter 1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;iter n&gt;</code> have
the form <code>&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;first&gt;:&lt;last&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;variable&gt;=&lt;first&gt;:&lt;last&gt;:&lt;stride&gt;</code>.
The values of <code>&lt;first&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;last&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;stride&gt;</code> should not refer to other iteration
variables.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;block statements&gt;</code> should be independent,
i.e., the order of the iterations should not matter. This means there
are some restrictions of what can be done in a do concurrent
statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>conditional statements should not transfer control out of the
iteration;</li>
<li>procedures called must be pure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that do concurrent statements can be nested.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">do concurrent (row = 1:size(matrix, 1))
    row_norm = 1.0_DP/sum(matrix(row, :))
    do concurrent (col = 1:size(matrix, 2))
        matrix(row, col) = matrix(row, col)*row_norm
    end do
end do</code></pre>
