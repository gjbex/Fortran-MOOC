<h1 id="text-output">Text output</h1>
<p>Fortran has fairly sophisticated input/output features. It has three
access modes, sequential, direct and stream access. File records can be
formatted or unformatted. Each of these access modes and record types
has its respective merits and you will learn about all of them.</p>
<p>I/O operations can be done on two types of files, internal, i.e., in
memory, and external, i.e., files on a file system. The latter is
arguably the most widely used, although there are applications for the
former as well. In Fortran, file operations are associated with unit
numbers, which you can compare with file descriptors in C.</p>
<p>In this section we will concentrate on formatted, sequential output
on external files.</p>
<h2 id="writing-data">Writing data</h2>
<p>Fortran has two statements to write data, <code>print</code> and
<code>write</code>. The print statement will write data to standard
output, i.e., the data that will be displayed by the terminal while your
application runs.</p>
<p>The write statement is more general since it can write to arbitrary
units, although it can be used to write to standard output as well when
the appropriate unit number is specified. The unit number of standard
output is defined in the intrinsic module <code>iso_fortran_env</code>
and is called <code>output_unit</code>.</p>
<p>A second distinction between the print and the write statements is
that the former can only do formatted, sequential output, while write
can do any type of output. Since the print statement is the simplest, we
will first discuss this.</p>
<h3 id="print-statement">print statement</h3>
<p>The general form of the print statement is given below.</p>
<pre><code>print &lt;fmt&gt;, &lt;list-of-expressions&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;list-of-expressions&gt;</code> is a comma separated
list of expressions, e.g., variables, mathematical expression or
function calls.</p>
<p>The simplest value for the format specifier <code>&lt;fmt&gt;</code>
is simply <code>*</code>. This leaves it up to the Fortran runtime to
determine the appropriate output format. For very simple I/O this may be
sufficient. The following code illustrates the default output format for
various data types.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>program print_test
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : SP =&gt; REAL32, DP =&gt; REAL64
    implicit none
    integer, parameter :: n = 15
    real(kind=SP), parameter :: x = 3.14_SP
    real(kind=DP), parameter :: y = 2.69_DP
    character(len=10), parameter :: c = 'abc'
    logical, parameter :: l = .true.
    type udf
        real :: x
        integer :: n
    end type udf
    type(udf), parameter :: u = udf(x = 3.5, n = 7)
    real, dimension(3) :: v = [ 3.5, 5.7, 7.3 ]
    integer, dimension(2, 3) :: A = reshape( [ 3, 7, 5, 9, 2, 4 ], [ 2, 3 ])

    print *, '|', n, '|'
    print *, '|', x, '|'
    print *, '|', y, '|'
    print *, '|', c, '|'
    print *, '|', l, '|'
    print *, '|', u, '|'
    print *, '|', v, '|'
    print *, '|', A, '|'
end program print_test</code></pre>
<p>This application produces the following output.</p>
<pre><code> |          15 |
 |   3.14000010     |
 |   2.6899999999999999      |
 |abc       |
 | T |
 |   3.50000000               7 |
 |   3.50000000       5.69999981       7.30000019     |
 |           3           7           5           9           2           4 |</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, using the <code>*</code> format specifier, the print
statement can print scalar values such as real and integer numbers,
logical and character values, but also user defined types and (multi-)
dimensional arrays.</p>
<p>Note the single space at the start of each line. Each print statement
will write to a new line of the output file.</p>
<p>Although this is no doubt the easiest way to write to standard
output, the formatting is likely not always what you want it to look
like. This is where non-trivial format specifiers come in.</p>
<h2 id="format-specification">Format specification</h2>
<p>To control the format of the output, the print statement allows to
provide a format string, also called edit descriptor. This can either be
a literal string, or a character variable.</p>
<p>For each data type, one or more descriptors are available, e.g.,
<code>I</code> for integer, <code>E</code> and <code>F</code> for real
values, <code>A</code> for characters and so on. The descriptor is
typically followed by a number indicating the number of characters to be
used to represent the value. If the width is not sufficient to represent
the values, <code>*</code> characters will be printed instead. It is
rather frustrating to perform a long computation, and end up with output
consisting (partly) of only asterisk symbols, so choose your width
wisely.</p>
<p>The following program illustrates the point.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>program print_asterisks
    implicit none
    integer :: i = 123456
    character(len=6) :: c = 'abcdef'

    print '(I8)', i
    print '(I4)', i

    print '(A8)', c
    print '(A4)', c

end program print_asterisks</code></pre>
<p>The output produced by this application is shown below.</p>
<pre><code>  123456
****
  abcdef
abcd</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it is possible to print character values with a width
that is less than the length of the string, but you loose
information.</p>
<h3 id="integer-edit-descriptor">Integer edit descriptor</h3>
<p>The edit descriptor for integer values is <code>I&lt;w&gt;</code>,
where <code>&lt;w&gt;</code> is a positive integer that specifies the
width. The value is right-aligned, and padded with spaces if necessary.
For positive values, no sign is printed.</p>
<p>For example, the descriptor <code>I5</code> would result in the
following output for</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>value</th>
<th>output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td><code>##123</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-123</td>
<td><code>#-123</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123456</td>
<td><code>*****</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-12345</td>
<td><code>*****</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The character <code>#</code> is used to visually represent a space,
it would of course not be written out.</p>
<p>A second form of the descriptor is <code>I&lt;w&gt;.&lt;d&gt;</code>
where <code>&lt;w&gt;</code> is again the width of the string to be
written, and <code>&lt;d&gt;</code> is the number of digits. If the
number of characters to represent the integer is less than
<code>&lt;d&gt;</code>, the value is padded with <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the descriptor <code>I5.3</code> would result in the
following output for</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>value</th>
<th>output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>123</td>
<td><code>##123</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td><code>##012</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1</td>
<td><code>#-001</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>123456</td>
<td><code>*****</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Obviously, <code>&lt;d&gt;</code> should be less than or equal to
<code>&lt;w&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>It is very convenient that <code>&lt;w&gt;</code> can be equal to 0,
in which case the minimum width required to show the value is
automatically computed. It can be combined with a specification for the
number of digits, e.g., <code>I0.4</code> which would apply zero-padding
for integer values with a width of less than 3.</p>
<h3 id="real-edit-descriptors">Real edit descriptors</h3>
<p>To format real values, quite some options are available. The most
common ones are <code>F</code> and <code>E</code>. They can be used for
single and double precision values.</p>
<h4 id="f-edit-descriptor"><code>F</code> edit descriptor</h4>
<p>The <code>F</code> format the real value in floating point notation.
Similar to the integer edit descriptor, the width <code>&lt;w&gt;</code>
should be specified, and optionally, <code>&lt;d&gt;</code>, the number
of digits after the decimal dot. For example, for <code>F6.2</code> the
following strings would be written.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>value</th>
<th>output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1.23</td>
<td><code>##1.23</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.239</td>
<td><code>##1.24</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1.23</td>
<td><code>#-1.23</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.23e-2</td>
<td><code>##0.01</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.23e-7</td>
<td><code>##0.00</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.23e7</td>
<td><code>******</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Similar to the integer edit descriptor, the width can also be 0 and
in that case the appropriate width will be computed, e.g.,
<code>F0.3</code> would write values with 3 digits after the decimal
dot.</p>
<h4 id="e-en-es-edit-descriptors"><code>E</code>, <code>EN</code>,
<code>ES</code> edit descriptors</h4>
<p>The <code>E</code> edit descriptor will output real values in
scientific notation. For example, for <code>E10.2</code> the output
would be.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>value</th>
<th>output</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1.23</td>
<td><code>##0.12e+01</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.29</td>
<td><code>##0.13e+01</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>-1.23</td>
<td><code>#-0.12e+01</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.23e5</td>
<td><code>##0.12e+06</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The results of edit descriptor can be somewhat inconsistent since
leading zeroes will be left out in order to fit the width if
required.</p>
<p>Note that the width <em>can not</em> be equal to zero according to
the Fortran specification. However, some compilers support it (GCC 10.x)
while others do not (Intel 2018).</p>
<p>The <code>E</code> edit descriptor can take a second form:
<code>e&lt;w&gt;.&lt;d&gt;e&lt;x&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;w&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;d&gt;</code> have the same semantics as previously
explained. The <code>&lt;x&gt;</code> is the number of digits used for
the exponent. For example, <code>E15.4e3</code>would write 123.45678 as
<code>####0.1235e+003</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>ES</code> descriptor is very similar to the <code>E</code>
edit descriptor, although it will ensure that the decimal is between 1
and 9. This output format is more in line with other programming
languages such as C, C++ and Python.</p>
<p>The <code>EN</code> produces output in engineering notation, rather
than scientific notation. For example, the value 12345.678 would be
written as <code>#12.35e+03</code> when using the edit descriptor
<code>EN10.2</code>.</p>
<p>There is a relationship between the width and the number of digits.
For single precision numbers,
<code>&lt;w&gt; &gt;= &lt;d&gt; + 7</code>, and
<code>&lt;w&gt; &gt;= &lt;d&gt; + 9</code> for double precision. For the
second from of the edit descriptors,
<code>&lt;w&gt; &gt;= &lt;d&gt; + &lt;x&gt; + 5</code>.</p>
<h4 id="complex-numbers">Complex numbers</h4>
<p>For complex numbers, two edit descriptors for real values have to be
provided. They can, but don’t have to be the same. For instance, the
edit descriptor <code>E10.3,E10.3</code> could be used.</p>
<p>Note that this would be better written as <code>2E10.3</code> as you
will see later.</p>
<h3 id="logical-edit-descriptor">Logical edit descriptor</h3>
<p>The edit descriptor for logical values is <code>L&lt;w&gt;</code>. It
will print <code>F</code> for false, <code>T</code> for true. The value
will be right-aligned, and padded with spaces if the width is larger
than one.</p>
<h3 id="character-edit-descriptor">Character edit descriptor</h3>
<p>The edit descriptor for character values is <code>A</code> or
<code>A&lt;w&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;w&gt;</code> represents the
width. If the width <code>&lt;w&gt;</code> is omitted, the length of the
string will be used. If the width is larger than the length of the
string, the output is left-aligned, and padded with spaces.</p>
<h3 id="general-edit-descriptor">General edit descriptor</h3>
<p>The general edit descriptor <code>G&lt;w&gt;.&lt;d&gt;</code> can be
used for integer, real, logical and character values. Its simplest form
is <code>G0</code> where it will choose the appropriate width for the
value. Although this is very convenient, you should note that for real
values, the number of digits is compiler dependent, so the code may not
be entirely portable.</p>
<h2 id="combining-descriptors">Combining descriptors</h2>
<p>Up to now, we have discussed edit descriptors for individual values.
However, you will often use edit descriptors to output multiple values.
For instance, to output a real value followed by an integer value, you
would use, e.g., `(E12.3, I5)’. The following code fragment illustrates
a full example.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
real :: x = 17.3e5
integer :: i = 19
...
print '(E12.3, I5)', x, i
...</code></pre>
<p>This would produce the following output. ~~~~ 0.173e+05 19 ~~~~</p>
<p>An edit descriptor can also be repeated, for instance, to write five
real numbers, you could use <code>(5E13.3)</code>. This repetion factor
can also be <code>*</code> to indicate an unlimited number of
repetitions, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>subroutine print_vector(label, vector)
    implicit none
    character(len=:), intent(in) :: label
    real, dimension(:), intent(in) :: vector

    print '(A, ": ", *(E13.3))', label, vector
end subroutine print_vector</code></pre>
<p>Parentheses can be used to group edit descriptors. For instance, to
print three pairs of a string and an integer value, you can use
<code>(3(A, I0))</code>.</p>
<p>The example above also illustrates that string literals can be part
of an edit descriptor, i.e., <code>": "</code> in this example.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>/</code> edit descriptor to start a new line,
e.g., the descriptor <code>(I0,/,I0)</code> would write the second
integer on the next line of output.</p>
<h2 id="output-to-files">Output to files</h2>
<p>Writing to a file is very similar to writing to standard output. The
write statement takes the unit number as its first argument. For
standard output and standard error, those are defined in the
<code>iso_fortran_env</code> module.</p>
<p>To write to a file, that file first has to be opened. You can either
specify a unit number yourself, or have the Fortran runtime assign one
for you.</p>
<p>The open statement takes a lot of arguments:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>unit</code>, the unit number to use, or <code>newunit</code>
to assign a new unit number;</li>
<li><code>file</code>, the file name to use;</li>
<li><code>access</code>, this can be <code>sequential</code>,
<code>direct</code> or <code>stream</code>;</li>
<li><code>action</code>, this can be <code>write</code>,
<code>readwrite</code> or <code>read</code>;</li>
<li><code>status</code>, this can be <code>new</code>, <code>old</code>,
<code>replace</code> or <code>scratch</code>;</li>
<li><code>form</code>, this can be <code>formatted</code> or
<code>unformatted</code>;</li>
<li><code>position</code>, this is the position to start writing, it can
be <code>rewind</code> or <code>append</code>;</li>
<li><code>iostat</code>, represents the exit status of the statement,
non-zero if there were issues;</li>
<li><code>iomsg</code>, this is the error message in case something went
wrong.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will learn about the options in other sections, here we will only
discuss <code>access='write'</code>, <code>status='new'</code>,
<code>status='replace'</code>, <code>form='formatted'</code>.</p>
<p>For example, you can use the following open statement to open a new
file <code>text.txt</code> for writing formatted output.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>program newunit_test
    use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : error_unit
    implicit none
    integer :: unit_nr, istat
    character(len=1024) :: msg

    open (newunit=unit_nr, file='text.txt', access='sequential', action='write', &amp;
          status='new', form='formatted', iostat=istat, iomsg=msg)
    if (istat /= 0) then
        write (unit=error_unit, fmt='(2A)') 'error: ', trim(msg)
        stop 1
     end if
     write (unit=unit_nr, fmt='(A)') 'hello world!'
     close (unit=unit_nr)
end program newunit_test</code></pre>
<p>The unit number will be assigned to the variable <code>unit_nr</code>
in the open statement, this is the most convenient way to avoid
conflicting unit numbers. The value assigned to the variable
<code>iostat</code> is checked, and if the value is non-zero, an error
message is written to the <code>error_unit</code>. If that is not the
case, the unit number can be used for subsequent operations, such as the
write statement. When all data has been written, the unit can be closed
using the close statement.</p>
<p>It is good practice to always use <code>iostat</code> to verify that
I/O operations succeeded, also in, e.g., write and close statements
where they have been omitted for the sake of brevity. For instance, a
write statement might fail because you exceed disk quota.</p>
<p>It is also good practice to close a unit. Failing to do so may result
in data loss or corrupt files when the unit was open for
<code>write</code> or <code>readwrite</code>.</p>
<p>The file name can be given as an absolute path, or, as in this
example, a relative path. In the latter case, the path is interpreted
relative to the current working directory as you would expect.</p>
<p>The status of the file can be <code>new</code>, <code>old</code> or
<code>replace</code> for action <code>write</code>. If the access is
<code>new</code>, an error occurs when the file already exists. If the
status is <code>old</code>, an error occurs when the file does not yet
exist. If the status is <code>replace</code>, a new file will be created
if it doesn’t exist yet, or it will be overwritten otherwise.</p>
<p>Most programming languages allow to open files directly in append
mode, i.e., new data will be added at the end of an existing file. This
is possible in Fortran as well, but it is somewhat more cumbersome. You
would have to open an existing file with status <code>old</code>, and
additionally specify <code>position='append'</code>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-strings">Creating strings</h2>
<p>Although this section is about writing to text files, as a small
aside, we will briefly discuss creating strings. The write statement can
be applied to a character variable to create a formatted string. As an
example, consider that you might want to let the number of digits in an
edit description for a real number depend on some runtime
conditions.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code>...
character(len=10) :: fmt_str
integer :: nr_digits
real :: x
...
write (fmt_str, "('(E', I0, '.', I0, ')')" nr_digits + 7, nr_digits
write (unit=output_unit, fmt=fmt_str) x
...</code></pre>
<p>If the variable <code>nr_digits</code> has the value 5, the value of
<code>fmt_str</code> would be `(E12.5)’.</p>
