<h1 id="fortran-for-scientific-programming">Fortran for scientific
programming</h1>
<p>Find out why you should consider Fortran to develop your next
scientific application. Although it is one of the oldest programming
languages in existence, it has evolved over the decades and has all the
features you would expect from a modern programming language. As opposed
to many other programming languages, it was specifically designed with
scientific computing in mind.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Want to learn a nice programming language for scientific
computing?</p>
<p>In this course, you’ll discover that Fortran is an excellent choice
for projects in the domain of scientific computing. You will see that
you can perform vector and matrix computations with very few lines of
code, both on real and complex values.</p>
<p>You will learn all about the data types defined in Fortran, as well
as the control statements that make up the language. You will also learn
about best practices and good coding style.</p>
<p>You will also see that Fortran has features such as dynamic memory
management and pointers, which allows you to deal with large amounts of
data efficiently, but also to build sophisticated data structures.</p>
<p>You will see that you can do object-oriented programming in Fortran,
designing your own classes to build modern applications.</p>
<p>Performance is often critical in scientific computing, so you’ll
learn about profiling, but also best practices and pitfalls specific to
Fortran.</p>
<p>Fortran has an ecosystem of libraries for scientific computing and
you will see some of the most relevant examples. You’ll also see how
Fortran can inter-operate with C and Python.</p>
<p>Finally, you will get a taste of doing parallel programming using
Fortran, both for shared memory and distributed computing.</p>

<p>Back in the 90s I studied artificial neural networks using techniques
of statistical physics to determine the capabilities and limitations of
such systems. I enjoyed creating simulations and solving equations
numerically. After an interlude as a knowledge engineer at a company
specialized in IP management I returned to research, but not to physics.
I studied the inference of grammars describing semi-structured data.
Currently, I’m working as an HPC analyst/consultant at Hasselt
University/KU Leuven supporting researchers and giving training.</p>

<p>During my physics studies I got interested in computational
physics/astrophysics. After several postdoctoral positions I joined the
Vlaaams Supercomputer Centrum (VSC) and I stay close to science by
supporting our HPC users.</p>
