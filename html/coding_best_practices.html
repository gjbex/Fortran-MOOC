<h1 id="coding-best-practices-reading-material">Coding best practices:
reading material</h1>
<p>A number of very simple things go a long way towards improving your
code substantially. For good programmers, they are second nature, and
you should strive to make them a habit.</p>
<h2 id="format-your-code-nicely">Format your code nicely</h2>
<p>To quote Robert C. Martin, “Code formatting is about communication,
and communication is the professional developer’s first order of
business”.</p>
<p>All programming languages have one or possibly multiple conventions
about how to format source code. For example, consistent indentation of
code helps considerably to assess the structure of a compilation unit at
a glance. For multi-level indentation, always use the same width, e.g.,
multiples of four spaces.</p>
<p>The convention you have to use is often determined by the community
you are working with, for instance your co-workers. It is best to stick
to that convention, since coding is communicating. If no convention is
established, consider introducing one. The one which is prevalent in the
programming language community is most likely to be your best
choice.</p>
<p>Whichever convention you follow, be consistent!</p>
<h2 id="use-language-idioms">Use language idioms</h2>
<p>Linguists use the term “idiom” for an expression that is very
specific to a certain language and that cannot be translated literally
to another. For instance, the English idiom “it is raining cats and
dogs” would translate to “il pleut des cordes” in French. The
corresponding idiom in French is completely unrelated to its counterpart
in English. Mastering idioms is one of the requirements for C1
certification, i.e., to be considered to have a proficiency close to
that of native speakers.</p>
<p>We observe a similar phenomenon for programming languages. Some
syntactic constructs are typical for a specific programming language
but, when translated one-to-one into another language, lead to code
constructs that are unfamiliar to programmers who are proficient in that
language. The code fragments below illustrate this.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">real, dimension(10) :: a
...
a = value</code></pre>
<p>rather than</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer :: i
real, dimension(10) :: a
...
do i = 1, 10
    a(i) = value
end do</code></pre>
<p>Using idioms, i.e., expressions that are particular to a
(programming) language, will make your code much easier to interpret
correctly by programmers that are fluent in that language.</p>
<h2 id="choose-descriptive-names">Choose descriptive names</h2>
<p>In a way, programming is storytelling. The data are the protagonists
in the story, and the procedures are the actions they take, or what
happens to them. Hence variable names should be nouns and procedures
names should be verbs. If a procedure returns a property, it should be
phrased as a question.</p>
<p>Any editor worth its salt provides completion, so you can’t argue in
favor of short but less descriptive names to save typing. A long but
descriptive name is just a tab character away.</p>
<p>Choosing descriptive names for variables and procedures is another
aspect that can make reading your code much easier. Consider the
following code fragment, and although I’ll grant that it is something of
a caricature, I’ve seen some in the wild that are not significantly
better.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">open (fn, 'data.txt')
do i = 1, n
    x = get(i, fn)
    if (condition(x)) then
        a = compute(x)
        if (a &lt; 3.14) &amp;
            call do_something(a)
    end if
end if
close (fn)</code></pre>
<p>A key principle of good software design is that of the least
surprise. Choosing appropriate names for our variables and procedures
helps a lot in this respect.</p>
<h2 id="keep-it-simple">Keep it <em>simple</em></h2>
<p>Ideally, code is simple. A procedure should have two levels of
indentation at most. This is advice you’ll find in the literature on
general purpose programming. Although this is good advice, there are
some caveats in the context of scientific computing.</p>
<p>However, the gist is clear: code is as simple as possible, but not
simpler.</p>
<p>Even for scientific code, a procedure has no more lines of code than
fit comfortably on your screen. It is all too easy to lose track of the
semantics if you can’t get an overview of the code. Remember, not
everyone has the budget for a 5K monitor.</p>
<p>If you find yourself writing a very long code fragment, ask yourself
whether that is atomic, or whether the task it represents can be broken
up into sub-tasks. If so, and that is very likely, introduce new
procedures for those sub-tasks with descriptive names. This will make
the narrative all the easier to understand.</p>
<p>A procedure should have a single purpose, i.e., you should design it
to do one thing, and one thing only.</p>
<p>For procedure signatures, simplicity matters as well. Procedures that
take many arguments may lead to confusion. In Fortran you can use
keyword arguments in procedure calls. Since accidentally swapping
argument values with the same type in a procedure call can lead to
interesting debugging sessions, you are strongly advised to use that
syntax feature. Consider the following procedure signature:</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">real function random_gaussian(mu, sigma)
    implicit none
    real, intent(in) :: mu, sigma
    ...
end function random_gaussian</code></pre>
<p>You would have to check the documentation to know the order of the
function arguments. Consider the following four function calls:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>random_gaussian(0.0, 1.0)</code>: okay;</li>
<li><code>random_gaussian(1.0, 0.0)</code>: not okay;</li>
<li><code>random_gaussian(mu=0.0, sigma=1.0)</code>: okay;</li>
<li><code>random_gaussian(sigma=1.0, mu=0.0)</code>: okay.</li>
</ol>
<p>The two last versions of this call are easier to understand, since
the meaning of the numbers is clear. Moreover, since you can use any
order, it eliminates a source of bugs.</p>
<h2 id="named-blocks">Named blocks</h2>
<p>Although it is best to try to avoid deeply nested blocks of code,
sometimes that is hard to avoid. In that case, you can use named blocks
to mitigate the complexity a little bit. The following code fragment
illustrates this.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
integer :: i, j
real, dimension(10, 15) :: A
...
column_loop: do j = 1, size(A, 2)
    row_loop: do i = 1, size(A, 1)
        ...
        neg_vals: if (A(i, j) &lt; 0.0) then
            ...
        end if neg_vals
        ...
    end do row_loop
    ...
    sum_cond:  if (sum(A(:, j) &gt; 0.0) then
        ...
    end if sum_cond
    ...
end do column_loop</code></pre>
<p>Simplifying the code by introducing some procedures is likely to be
the better option though.</p>
<h2 id="limit-scope">Limit scope</h2>
<p>Many programmers will declare all variables at the start of a
compilation unit. This is a syntax requirement in Fortran.</p>
<p>Limiting the scope of declarations to a minimum reduces the
probability of inadvertently using the variable, but it also improves
code quality: the declaration of the variable is at the same location
where the variable is first used, so the narrative is easier to
follow.</p>
<p>Fortran requires that variables are declared at the start of a
compilation unit, i.e., <code>program</code>, <code>function</code>,
<code>subroutine</code>, <code>module</code>, but Fortran 2008
introduced the <code>block</code> statement in which local variables can
be declared. Their scope doesn’t extend beyond the <code>block</code>.
Modern compilers support this Fortran 2008 feature.</p>
<p>Note that Fortran still allows variables to be implicitly typed,
i.e., if you don’t declare a variable explicitly, its type will be
<code>integer</code> if its starts with the characters <code>i</code> to
<code>n</code>, otherwise its type will be <code>real</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the code fragment below. Since the variables were not
declared explicitly, <code>i</code> is interpreted as
<code>integer</code> and <code>total</code> as <code>REAL</code>.
However, the misspelled <code>totl</code> is also implicitly typed as
<code>real</code>, initialized to <code>0.0</code>, and hence the value
of <code>total</code> will be <code>10.0</code> when the iterations
ends, rather than <code>100.0</code> as was intended.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">integer :: i
real :: total
do i = 1, 10
    total = totl + 10.0
end do</code></pre>
<p>To avoid these problems caused by simple typos, use the
<code>implicit none</code> statement before variable declarations in
<code>program</code>, <code>module</code>, <code>function</code>,
<code>subroutine</code>, and <code>block</code>, e.g,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">implicit none
integer :: i
real :: total
do i = 1, 10
    total = totl + 10.0
end do</code></pre>
<p>The compiler would give an error for the code fragment above since
all variables have to be declared explicitly, and <code>totl</code> was
not.</p>
<p>In Fortran it is possible to restrict what to use from modules,
e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : REAL64, INT32</code></pre>
<p>The <code>only</code> keyword ensures that only the parameters
<code>REAL64</code> and <code>INT32</code> are imported from the
<code>iso_fortran_env</code> module.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>intrinsic</code> keyword is used to ensure that
the compiler supplied module is used, and not a module with the same
name defined by you.</p>
<p>When developing multi-threaded C/C++ programs using OpenMP, limiting
the scope of variables to parallel regions makes those variables
thread-private, hence reducing the risk of data races. We will discuss
this in more detail in a later section. Unfortunately, the semantics for
the Fortran <code>block</code> statement in an OpenMP do loop is not
defined, at least up to the OpenMP 4.5 specification. Although
<code>gfortran</code> accepts such code constructs, and seems to
generate code with the expected behavior, it should be avoided since
Intel Fortran compiler will report an error for such code.</p>
<h2 id="be-explicit-about-constants">Be explicit about constants</h2>
<p>If a variable’s value is not supposed to change during the run time
of a program, declare it as a constant, so that the compiler will warn
you if you inadvertently modify its value. You can use
<code>parameter</code> to that effect.</p>
<p>If arguments passed to procedures should be read-only, use
<code>intent(in)</code> (or <code>value</code>) . Although the Fortran
standard doesn’t require that you state the intent of arguments passed
to procedures, it is nevertheless wise to do so. The compiler will catch
at least some programming mistakes if you do.</p>
<h2 id="control-access">Control access</h2>
<p>When defining classes in Fortran, some attention should be paid to
accessibility of elements of the user defined types. An object’s state
is determined by the value of these elements , so allowing unrestricted
access to them may leave the object in an inconsistent state.</p>
<p>Elements in user defined types and procedures defined in modules are
public by default. Regardless of the defaults, it is useful to specify
the access restrictions explicitly. It is good practice to specify
private access as the default, and public as the exception to that
rule.</p>
<p>Interestingly, both Fortran and C++ have the keyword
<code>protected</code>, albeit with very different semantics. In
Fortran, <code>protected</code> means that a variable defined in a
module can be read by the compilation unit that uses it, but not
modified. In the module where it is defined, it can be modified though.
In C++, an attribute or a method that is declared <code>protected</code>
can be accessed from derived classes as well as the class that defines
it. However, like attributes and methods declared <code>private</code>,
it can not be accessed elsewhere.</p>
<p>This is another example where getting confused about the semantics
can lead to interesting bugs.</p>

<h2 id="variable-initialization">Variable initialization</h2>
<p>The specification for Fortran does not define the value an
uninitialized variable will have. So you should always initialize
variables explicitly, otherwise your code will have undefined, and
potentially non-deterministic behavior. When you forget to initialize a
variable, the compilers will typically let you get away with it.
However, most compilers have optional flags that catch expressions
involving uninitialized variables. We will discuss these and other
compiler flags in a later section.</p>
<p>When initializing or, more generally, assigning a value to a variable
that involves constants, your code will be easier to understand when
those values indicate the intended type. For example, using
<code>1.0</code> rather than <code>1</code> for floating point is more
explicit. This may also avoid needless conversions. This also prevents
arithmetic bugs since <code>1/2</code> will evaluate to <code>0</code>.
Perhaps even more subtly, <code>1.25 + 1/2</code> will also evaluate to
<code>1.25</code>, since the division will be computed using integer
values, evaluating to <code>0</code>, which is subsequently converted to
the floating point value <code>0.0</code>, and added to
<code>1.25</code>.</p>
<h2 id="to-comment-or-not-to-comment">To comment or not to comment?</h2>
<p>Comments should never be a substitute for code that is easy to
understand. In almost all circumstances, if your code requires a comment
without which it can not be understood, it can be rewritten to be more
clear.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are exceptions to this rule. Sometimes we have no
alternative but to sacrifice a clean coding style for performance, or we
have to add an obscure line of code to prevent a problem caused by
over-eager compilers.</p>
<p>If you need to add a comment, remember that it should be kept
up-to-date with the code. All too often, we come across comments that
are no longer accurate because the code has evolved, but the
corresponding comment didn’t. In such situations, the comment is
harmful, since it can confuse us about the intentions of the developer,
and at the least, it will cost us time to disambiguate.</p>
<p>The best strategy is to make sure that the code tells its own story,
and requires no comments.</p>
<p>A common abuse of comments is to disable code fragments that are no
longer required, but that you still want to preserve. This is bad
practice. Such comments make reading the code more difficult, and take
up valuable screen real estate. Moreover, when you use a version control
system such as git or subversion in your development process, you can
delete with impunity, in the sure knowledge that you can easily retrieve
previous versions of your files. If you don’t use a version control
system routinely, you really should. See the additional material section
for some pointers to information and tutorials.</p>
<h2 id="stick-to-the-standard">Stick to the standard</h2>
<p>The official syntax and semantics of a programming language like
Fortran are defined in official specifications. All compilers that claim
compliance with these standards have to implement these
specifications.</p>
<p>However, over the years, compiler developers have added extensions to
the specifications. The Intel Fortran compiler for instance can trace
its ancestry back to the DEC compiler, and implements quite a number of
Fortran extensions. Similarly, the GCC <code>gfortran</code> compiler
supports some non-standard features as well.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that your code should not rely on such
compiler specific extensions, even if that compiler is mainstream and
widely available. There is no guarantee that future releases of that
same compiler will still support the extension, and the only official
information about that extension would be available in the compiler
documentation, not always the most convenient source.</p>
<p>Moreover, that implies that even if your code compiles with a
specific compiler, that doesn’t mean it complies with the official
language specification. An other compiler would simply generate error
message for the same code, and would fail to compile it.</p>
<p>Using language extensions makes code harder to read. As a proficient
programmer, you’re still not necessarily familiar with language
extensions, so you may interpret those constructs incorrectly.</p>
<p>Hence I’d encourage you strongly to strictly adhere to a specific
language specification. The relevant specification for Fortran are those
of 2003 (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004), 2008 (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010) and 2018
(ISO/IEC 1539-1:2018). References to those specifications can be found
in the section on additional material.</p>
<h2 id="copypaste-is-evil">Copy/paste is evil</h2>
<p>If you find yourself copying and pasting a fragment of code from one
file location to another, or from one file to another, you should
consider turning it into a procedure. Apart from making your code easier
to understand, it makes it also easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a bug in the fragment. If you copy/pasted it, you
would have to remember to fix the bug in each instance of that code
fragment. If it was encapsulated in a procedure, you would have to fix
the problem in a single spot only.</p>
