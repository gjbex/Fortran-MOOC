<h1 id="ieee-754-standard-for-floating-point-arithmetic">IEEE 754
standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">This standard</a>
was established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
(IEEE) in 1985 to address various issues encountered when performing
floating point arithmetic.</p>
<p>The standard defines:</p>
<ul>
<li>arithmetic formats: sets of binary and decimal floating-point data,
which consist of finite numbers (including signed zeros and subnormal
numbers), infinities, and special “Not a Number” values (NaNs);</li>
<li>interchange formats: encodings (bit strings) that may be used to
exchange floating-point data in an efficient and compact form;</li>
<li>rounding rules: properties to be satisfied when rounding numbers
during arithmetic and conversions;</li>
<li>operations: arithmetic and other operations (such as trigonometric
functions) on arithmetic formats;</li>
<li>exception handling: indications of exceptional conditions (such as
division by zero, overflow, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly a standard such as this is crucial for interoperability and
compatibility between systems and programming languages. The standard
has been widely adopted.</p>
<p>Fortran supports the IEEE 754 standard via three intrinsic
modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ieee_exceptions</code>;</li>
<li><code>ieee_arithmetic</code>;</li>
<li><code>ieee_features</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this was a “late” addition, these modules were introduced
only in the Fortran 2003 specification, and it has taken more than a
decade before compilers added reliable support for them.</p>
<p>Recently John Gustafson proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unum_(number_format)">Unum</a>, an
alternative to IEEE 754 that has many interesting properties and
generated considerable attention from vendors in the scientific
computing market, but thus far no implementations have emerged.</p>
<h2 id="versus--0.0">0.0 versus -0.0</h2>
<p>IEEE 754 specifies two ways to represent zero, positive and negative.
The Fortran specification states that <code>0.0 == -0.0</code>. This is
illustrated by the program below.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">program ieee754
    implicit none
    real :: zero, minus_zero = 0

    minus_zero = sign(zero, -1.0)
    print '(A, 2F7.2)', '0 vs. -0: ', zero, minus_zero
    if (zero == minus_zero) then
        print '(A)', '0 == -0'
    else
        print '(A)', '0 / -0'
    end if
    print '(A, F5.1)', 'sqrt(0.0) = ', sqrt(zero)
    print '(A, F5.1)', 'sqrt(-0.0) = ', sqrt(minus_zero)
end program ieee754</code></pre>
<p>So although positive and negative zero have two distinct bit
representations, the values are arithmetically the same, although they
have distinct string representations for formatted output.</p>
<h2 id="infinity">Infinity</h2>
<p>Some operations such as raising a number to a large power, or
dividing it by a very small number will yield <code>Infinity</code> or
<code>-Infinity</code>. These are valid IEEE 754 values and can be
computed with.</p>
<p>Needless to say that you are likely to be disappointed with the
result of your computation since any operation on an infinite value will
result in an infinite value or a NaN. However, it is easy to check
whether a value is finite or not.</p>
<p>The intrinsic module <code>ieee_arithmetic</code> has a function
<code>ieee_is_finite</code> that will return <code>.true.</code> when
its argument is finite, <code>.false.</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>In the same intrinsic module you will find a function
<code>ieee_value</code> that can be used to create a positive or
negative IEEE representation for infinity. The constants
<code>ieee_positive_inf</code> and <code>ieee_negative_inf</code> will
determine the value.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
use, intrinsic :: ieee_arithmetic, only : ieee_value, ieee_positive_inf
use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only : DP =&gt; REAL32
real(kind=DP) :: infinity
...
infinity = ieee_value(0.0_DP, ieee_positive_inf)
...</code></pre>
<p>The first argument of the function <code>ieee_value</code> is a real
value that is used to determine the kind of the result. The second
argument is the IEEE class.</p>
<h2 id="not-a-number-nan">Not a Number (NaN)</h2>
<p>Some arithmetic operations are not well-defined, e.g., division of 0
by 0, or the square root of a negative number. The IEEE 754
representation of the “result” of such a computation is NaN (Not a
Number). Further computations with NaN will result in further NaN
values.</p>
<p>Interestingly, NaN is the only IEEE 754 number that is not equal to
itself.</p>
<p>As with infinite values, you may want to check. This can be done
using the <code>ieee_is_nan</code> function defined in the intrinsic
module <code>ieee_arithmetic</code>. It returns <code>.true.</code> if
the argument is NaN, <code>.false.</code> otherwise.</p>
<p>A NaN value can be constructed explicitly using
<code>ieee_value</code> for the class <code>ieee_quiet_nan</code>.</p>
<h2 id="controlling-ieee-exception-handling">Controlling IEEE exception
handling</h2>
<p>The IEEE 754 standard defines five execptions: *
<code>IEEE_INVALID</code>; * <code>IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO</code>; *
<code>IEEE_OVERFLOW</code>; * <code>IEEE_UNDERFLOW</code>; *
<code>IEEE_INEXACT</code>.</p>
<p>An <code>IEEE_INVALID</code> exception occurs for invalid
mathematical operations such as the ones we discussed in the section
‘Not a Number (NaN)’ above. Similarly, an <code>IEEE_OVERFLOW</code>
exception is thrown when an arithmetic computation results in positive
or negative infinity as discussed in the section ‘Infinity’ above. As
the name implies <code>IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO</code> occurs whenever you
divide by zero.</p>
<p>These three exceptions are the ones you are mostly interested in.
<code>IEEE_USUAL</code> is an array that defines them for
convenience.</p>
<p>The <code>IEEE_UNDERFLOW</code> exception can sometimes be of
interest. It occurs when a small positive or negative value is computed
that can not be represented by a normal number. The IEEE 754 standard
allows for gradual underflow by using denormalized (or subnormal)
numbers.</p>
<p>The <code>IEEE_INEXACT</code> exception occurs when precision is
lost. Since this happens for many floating point computations, this
exception is typically not of interest.</p>
<p>You can control whether a program halts when an IEEE exception occurs
either</p>
<ul>
<li>globally using a compiler flag (e.g.,
<code>-ffpe-trap=invalid,zero,overlow</code>), or</li>
<li>in your code by using the <code>ieee_set_halting_mode</code>
subroutine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter method allows much greater control since you can switch
the halting mode to true for specific procedures or calculations. For
instance, the statement below will set the halting mode for
<code>IEEE_INVALID</code> to true, which means that the program will
halt when an invalid operation occurs.</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">call ieee_set_halting_mode(IEEE_INVALID, .true.)</code></pre>
<p>At some later point in the code, you can switch the halting mode back
to false by using the same call with <code>.false.</code> as the
argument.</p>
<p>The value of the halting mode can be checked at any point using</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
logical :: stat
...
call ieee_get_halting_mode(IEEE_INVALID, stat)
...</code></pre>
<h2 id="checking-for-ieee-exceptions">Checking for IEEE exceptions</h2>
<p>Regardless of the halting mode the processor will set flags when an
exception occurs. A flag can be quiet (<code>.false.</code>) or
signalling (<code>.true.</code>) where the latter indicates that an
exception was thrown.</p>
<p>The value of a flag can be checked using the subroutine
<code>ieee_get_flag</code> with the flag type and a logical variable as
argument, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
logical :: stat
...
call ieee_get_flag(IEEE_INVALID, stat)
...</code></pre>
<p>Depending on the value of <code>stat</code>, appropriate action can
be taken.</p>
<p>You can also check for all the “usual suspects” at once using the
array <code>IEEE_USUAL</code>, i.e.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">...
local, dimension(size(IEEE_USUAL)) :: stats
...
call ieee_get_flag(IEEE_USUAL, stats)
if (any(stats)) then
    ...
end if</code></pre>
<p>You can also clear the flags when you have dealt with the exception
and your computation is ready to proceed, e.g.,</p>
<pre class="fortran"><code class="language-fortran">call ieee_set_flag(IEEE_INVALID, .false.)</code></pre>
